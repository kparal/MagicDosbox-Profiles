# Magic DosBox game profiles

This repo contains my game profiles for [Magic DosBox] ([Play Store]). You can
use them to play old DOS games on your Android device (more comfortably than
with just a vanilla DOSBox). They're free as in freedom, i.e. you're welcome to
create your own profiles based on mine and distribute them, or anything else
you wish. Just please note that some parts of those profiles might be
copyrighted (images, manuals), although often abandonware at this time. Each
profile directory has its own README file.

When looking for more game profiles, be sure to check [Magic DosBox forum],
especially the [profile sharing category].
