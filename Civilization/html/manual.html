<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Civilization</i> is not copy-protected. This means you can copy the game
files from the original disks however you prefer -- to other floppy
disks, or to a hard disk. These files are normal in all respects, and
should not cause special problems when backing up, restoring, or
optimizing a hard disk. However, keep the original disks handy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Civilization</i> has been left unprotected for your convenience in
making back-up copies and when playing from a hard drive. However, making
additional copies to give away or sell is a Copyright violation. See the Copyright notice at the end of this game manual.</font></font></td></tr>

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Installation on Floppy Disks</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simulation is designed to run using copies of the original
(distribution) disks, but no information will be supplied in the box. You
can run the game using the distribution disks, but no information will be
saved. We suggest making back-up copies of and using those to play from.
A description of how to make back-up copies follows. Also, format disks
before doing any copies -- to make sure the disk is "clean" and in good
operating condition.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Format a Floppy Disk:</b> Formatting a disk requires that you boot your
computer with DOS, and at the "&gt;" prompt type the appropriate format
command. For example, on most machines, this is "FORMAT A:" to format a
floppy disk in the A: floppy drive. For details, consult the description
of "FORMAT" in your DOS manual.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the type of drive that you have, format one disk for
each of the game disks and one disk for your save-game files.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Copy to newly formatted disks:</b> After formatting disks, now use the
DOS "COPY" command to copy the disks with *.* as the file designators.
Typically, this command is entered as "COPY A:*.* B:*.*", even if you
just have one floppy drive. For details, consult the description of
"COPY" in your DOS manual.</font></font></td></tr>

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Installation on a Hard Disk</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can copy the original (distribution) disks onto a hard disk. The
files copied are standard DOS files. They can be copied, erased, and
optimized as desired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Install Program:</b> For your convenience, batch files are included that
automatically install the program onto your hard disk. To use these
files, place the "#1" disk in your A: drive, type either "INSTALLC",
"INSTALLD", or "INSTALLE", and press Return (Enter), and follow the
prompts. Use the command INSTALLC f your hard drive has only one
partition. Use the INSTALLD or INSTALLE command if your hard drive has
more than one partition and you would like to install the game on your
second or third partition.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Warning:</b> The install batch file assumes that you will install from a
floppy drive A: onto hard disk C:, D:, or E:. If your hardware
configuration is different, do not use the batch file. Instead, you must
manually copy the files from the floppy to the hard disk, using the DOS
"COPY" command.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Technical Notes:</b> This install program creates a subdirectory on your
hard disk titled "MPS" and a subdirectory of it titled "CIV". The program
copies all files into the CIV subdirectory. It then copies a runtime
batch file into the MPS directory titled "CIV.BAT", for your convenience.
Experienced IBM users should feel free to modify or move "CIV.BAT".</font></font></td></tr>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Roland LAPC-1 MIDI Board:</b> Only use this option if you've added this
sound board to your computer. An MT-32 or CM32L can also be used with an
MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface. If you encounter problems when using
Roland sound hardware, remove any other MIDI input connection and try
again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Custom Drivers:</b> In the future, MicroProse may supply custom sound
drivers for new sound boards. To install one of these, copy it into your
game directory (disk B if on floppies), rename the driver program to
XSOUND.EXE and select "Custom sound driver" when starting the game.</font></font></td></tr>

be found on disk in an ASCII file named "READ.ME", which can be read with
standard DOS commands such as "TYPE READ.ME".
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the program does not load or run correctly, turn off your machine
and restart it. Make sure DOS and Civilization are the only programs
loading into memory. Certain RAM-resident programs or tools can conflict
with Civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you receive a message stating that you do not have enough memory,
try playing with EGA graphics instead of VGA or with IBM sound instead of
Ad-Lib or Roland sound.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue to have trouble, try the original Civilization
disks. Your copies may be bad. If the original doesn't work, try the
original Civilization disks in another PC. If the disks work in another
machine, then your machine has compatibility problems (i.e., some aspect
is not entirely IBM compatible). Try a different machine speed, or a
keyboard/mouse, graphics, or sound option. Sometimes an alternate setting
will work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have trouble loading on other machines as well as your own,
you may be one of the tiny percentage with a defective disk. In such
cases, contact <b>MicroProse Customer Service at (410) 771-1151, Monday

Scientists by pressing the number key that corresponds to the Specialist.
For example, to convert the second Entertainer from the left into a
Scientist, press the 2 key twice. The first press of the 2 key converts
him into a taxman and the second converts the taxman into a scientist. A
third press makes him an entertainer again.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Civilization</i> casts you as the ruler of an entire civilization
through many generations, from the founding of the first cities 6,000
years ago to the imminent colonization of space. It combines the forces
that shaped history and the evolution of technology in a competitive
environment. You have great flexibility in your plans and strategies, but
to survive, you must successfully respond to the forces that historically
shaped the past.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When play begins, your civilization is small and requires only a few
decisions each turn. But each decision can have important ramifications
later. A number of displays make it easy to understand the issues and
implement action. If you prove an able ruler, your civilization grows
larger and even more interesting to manage. Inevitable contact with
neighbors opens new doors of opportunity: treaties, embassies, sabotage,
trade, and war.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time passes, the number of important decisions required each turn
increases. First you must think tactically: location of cities,
production of military units or city improvements, exploration of the
immediately surrounding lands. Soon, strategic plans must be formulated:
war or peace with immediate neighbors, when to explore and expand
overseas, when to change your type of government, where to focus
technological research.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the civilization that you build depends upon your
decisions. As ruler, you manage the economy, diplomacy, explorations,
technology research, and war machine. Your policies must be flexible in
an evolving world. Military units inevitably become obsolete and need
replacement as more advanced technologies appear. The balance of power
among your rivals can shift. Economic and governmental policies may have
to be modified, lest you fall behind in critical technologies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past civilizations of Alexander the Great, the Hittities,
Napoleon, Genghis Khan, and others all held pride of place on the world's
stage at one time, but all eventually collapsed. You are challenged in
<i>Civilization</i> to build an empire that stands the test of time. You may
succeed where your predecessors failed. If you locate cities properly,
build them soundly, defend them aggressively, and neutralize the danger
from potential enemies, the descendants of your tribe may not only
survive, but lead the colonization of space.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><font size="3"><b><a name="2b"></a>CITIES AND CIVILIZATIONS</b></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilizations appeared as agriculture and technology developed to
the point where humankind could gather food and live in cities. With only
part of the population needed to provide food for all, the rest could
afford to specialize in the tool making, trading, engineering, and
managing, that urbanization made possible. Specialization improved
efficiency and production. Cities encouraged a rapid exchange of ideas. A
teacher could reach many students at once, not just a few.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City residents cultivated the nearby fields, logged the forests, and
gathered fish from the rivers, returning each night with the result of
their labors. This produce and raw material was bartered in the city
markets for the goods and services of others. Charcoal from one area and
iron ore from another might be taken into the town smelter who made the
iron that the blacksmith turned into tools.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cities developed unique problems. As they grew in size it became
more difficult to provide sufficient food from nearby farmland. Over-
crowding, menial jobs, and living conditions often led to unrest among
the poorer citizens. Prosperous cities became tempting targets for rival
civilizations and barbarian invaders. Cities and civilizations that
developed better management and new solutions to these grew and
prospered. Those that failed have left their ruins around the world as
warnings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Civilization</i>, as in history, a key step and a fundamental concept
is the founding and management of cities. The civilization you are about
to rule begins as a prehistoric wandering tribe that has just reached
that critical stage where it is capable of building cities. The first
step is to build one city and from there expand. As your civilization
grows, cities will spread over several islands and continents.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each city acts as a giant processing plant for the food, resources,
and trade of the adjacent lands. The people of a city go out and work the
nearby farmland, mines, forests, and the city converts the result of
their labor into more people, armies, cash, luxury goods, temples,
universities, etc. Raw materials are transformed by cities into the power
and ideas your civilization needs to prosper.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food that is collected feeds the local population. When there is a
food surplus the population grows. Your first city has a small population
that can only work part of the land the city controls. As the city
population grows, more land can be worked, increasing production. Before
long you can afford to send settlers from the first city to another
nearby.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources are the lumber, metals, energy sources, and other raw
materials that are used in industry. Through the craftsmen and shops of
the city these resources are made into items useful at home or elsewhere
in your civilization. Larger cities normally generate more resources and
thus build things faster. Each city can build only one item at a time.
This could be a military unit such as a Phalanx or Battleship, a city
improvement such as a Temple or University, or perhaps a Wonder of the
World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade is generated by the highways of commerce: roads, rivers, and
oceans. All nearby trade passes through the city bringing in luxury
goods, cash, and new ideas. Your policies can adjust how trade is divided
among luxury goods, cash, or research. There may be times when a city
requires more luxury goods to make more people happy, or times when more
tax revenues are needed in the treasury. Higher taxes mean more revenue,
but may result in more people becoming unhappy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As your cities grow they require more care in keeping them
productive. Large cities are desirable for production but have inherent
problems. A critical one you must deal with is the happiness of the
population. The people can range from happy, to content, to unhappy.
Having to many unhappy people may lead to revolt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxury goods make people happy but may mean fewer tax revenues or a
reduced flow of technology. By adjusting the flow of luxuries, changing
types of government, building city improvements, instituting martial law,
and other means, it is possible to keep even the largest city content and
productive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is a second concept fundamental to <i>Civilization</i>. To make
the transition from wandering hunter-gatherers to city dwellers,
humankind had to possess some essential knowledge and skills. To advance
beyond the first stages of city dwelling requires a corresponding advance
in knowledge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of <i>Civilization</i>, with your tribe poised on the
threshold of history, they already possess some basic knowledge. The
people understand agriculture, irrigation, construction of roads, and the
construction of homes and other buildings. But this isn't enough
knowledge to survive through the coming ages. Learning new technologies
opens the door to new abilities. A small island-bound civilization that
learns Map Making can now build ships and expand overseas.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time it takes to acquire new technology depends on how much of
your trade is allotted to new ideas. You must choose between luxuries
that make the people happy, cash for the treasury, and technology
research. The more trade allocated to this research, the faster the next
step is acquired. When enough research has been done, your civilization
acquires the new technology and can begin working on something new.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world where your civilization exists is mostly unknown to you, a
mystery except in the immediate vicinity. To find out more about it you
must explore. Not only is the world hidden, but also unknown are the
locations of other civilizations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other civilizations, especially those nearby, complicate your tasks
as ruler. Each is ruled by one of your peers, and they are competing for
the same resources and opportunities as you. They also are looking to
expand and grow; at your expense if given the chance. Once contact is
made, you can no longer concentrate solely on the growth and expansion of
your civilization. Now you must assess the strength of rivals, adequately
provide for the defense of your cities in case of war, or consider making
war yourself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful wars can be very useful. Capturing cities is much easier
than building them up from nothing, and may provide loot in stolen
technology and cash. Weakening rivals reduces the threat they pose.
However, long, costly wars may allow unengaged rivals to expand and grow
in strength while you spend resources on arms.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore the unknown and contend with your rivals, you can build
armies, navies, and other special units in your cities. Once an army or
naval unit has been built, it is available for movement and combat. These
units extend the power of your civilization around the world. When they
enter hidden areas of the world, the shroud of mystery is removed and
that area becomes known. In this way you uncover the world, finding
suitable areas for new cities and eventually making contact with other
civilizations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three special units are available that can be useful to a ruler.
Settlers are groups of citizens that are your pioneers. They may found
new cities and also build terrain improvements such as roads, irrigation,
and mines that increase the productivity of your cities. Diplomats are
your emissaries and spies. They can establish embassies with rivals and
also perform a number of cloak and dagger tasks. Caravans are bands of
merchants that transport the produce of your cities around the world to
other cities, bringing in cash and establishing trade routes. Trade
routes increase the trade of the home city, resulting in more cash,
luxuries, and technology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonders of the World are unique city improvements, usually
structures, that can only built once in the entire world. Once a
particular Wonder is built by a city, no other city may build it. Each
Wonder brings glory to the civilization owning it, and some unique
tangible benefit as well. For example, if one of your cities builds the
Oracle, all Temples throughout your civilization become twice as
effective in making people content.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental concepts for a successful civilization are the
expansion and growth of your cities, and acquiring new technology. In a
word, you must grow. In this dynamic world environment, surrounded by
rivals in unknown corners, there is no future in complacency and
stagnation. You must press forward on all three fronts: spread your
cities out to claim a significant share of the world, increase the size
and production of each city, and strive to acquire the latest technology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your civilization cannot afford to lag to far behind in any of these
three spheres. A sufficient number of powerful cities can maintain the
quantity of your military in any arms race. Keeping abreast of technology
assures the quality.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hittites on antiquity had a brief moment of glory because the
technology of their weapons was superior to that of their neighbors. But
those neighbors had much larger populations, and when they acquired the
same technologies, the Hittites were ushered off the world's stage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cortez landed at the Aztec city of Vera Cruz with only a few hundred
conquistadors, but with the aid of superior weapons and diplomacy, he
soon had Montezuma crying in his chocolate. The Aztecs were deposed
because they could not learn the technology of the Spanish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what you can to keep your civilization growing in every area.
More and larger cities, better technology, and better armies mean
survival. Each city must be planned, managed, and protected so that it
contributes to the power and glory of your civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By maintaining this pattern of growth over the years, you have the
best chance of avoiding the fate of the Hittites and Montezuma.<br>

discussion of the interface pertains to that version.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface of <i>Civilization</i> is designed to take advantage of the
mouse. It may be played with a keyboard-only interface, but play is
faster if you have a mouse available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface operates mainly through two main game displays, the
map display and the city display. Each of these displays is described in
detail in its own manual section. Across the top of the map display is a
menu bar. From the menus available here you can reach additional game
functions and information not available from the displays.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface relies heavily on menus that are used in a similar
manner. Labeled buttons are also used in several places to perform a game
function or reach further information.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Using the Mouse:</b>
 To click the mouse on some part of the game, move the torch that is the
 pointer onto the desired location and click the correct mouse button.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IBM mouse has 
two buttons and the interface makes a distinction between them. The left
 mouse button (LMB) is used to perform actions such as scrolling the map
 or activating a unit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Menu Choices:</b> Throughout the manual you are instructed to pull
down menus to open them up and reveal the options they contain. To open a
menu using the mouse, place the pointer on the name of the menu in the
menu bar and press the LMB. If you click the button the menu opens and
stays open. Alternatively, you can press and hold the button, and then
drag the pointer down the list of options.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When playing with the keyboard-only interface a shortcut key can be
used to open the menus of the menu bar.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Menu Choices:</b> To choose a menu option, place the mouse pointer on
your selection and click the LMB.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, if you pull down a menu, the options are highlighted
as you pass over them. When the option you wish is highlighted, let the

production, growth, unrest, maintenance, and scientific research. These
concepts are explained in detail in the manual chapter Cities. All steps
are carried out for one city before the next is checked.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Production:</b> If the city produces sufficient surplus resources to
complete the item the city is producing, that item is added to the city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your city does not produce sufficient resources to support all of
the existing units for which it is the home city, units are destroyed
until enough support is available. Unit farthest away from the city are
destroyed first.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Growth:</b> If the city produces sufficient surplus food, it grows by
one population point. This added population is put to work on the city
map.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disorder:</b> If the number of unhappy citizens exceeds the number of
happy citizens due to population growth or the destruction of a city
improvement by disaster, your city goes into civil disorder. You receive
a message reporting this condition.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the first turn of disorder, you jump ahead to the
affected city's display so that adjustments can be made to return the
city to order. If the situation is not corrected, in following turns you
are notified that disorder continues.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Maintenance:</b> Taxes collected from the city are added to your
treasury. Then maintenance costs for improvements in this city are
deducted. If you don't have sufficient funds in your treasury to pay the
maintenance costs, one improvement is this city, chosen by local leaders,
is sold.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that when your civilization as a whole may have a revenue
surplus for the turn, you can still lose an improvement when your
treasury is low. High maintenance costs for the first cities checked may
deplete the treasury and force a sale before later cities contribute
their cash surpluses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Scientific Research:</b> The research contributed by this city, measured
by the number of light bulbs it produces, is added to the total so far
accumulated by your civilization. If this total is sufficient to acquire
the technology you have instructed your scientists to study, you receive
a message informing you that you have obtained this new technology.</font></td></tr>

your active units. While a unit is moving it may engage in combat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each active unit is designated for movement, one after another. Each
unit has the option of moving, not moving, or delaying its move until
later in the turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat occurs when a unit attempts to enter a map square occupied by
a unit or city of another civilization. (Exceptions are made for
Diplomats and Caravans.) Normally, either the attacking unit or all
defensive units are destroyed when combat is resolved. A victorious unit
with movement points left may continue moving and even attack again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this movement phase you may pause to perform all other
management tasks for your civilization. You may wish to consult with your
advisors concerning the state of your civilization's trade, or science,
or check the attitude of your population. You can examine any or all of
your cities to adjust their work forces or production. This is the time
to change tax rates, governments, or examine the state of international
affairs.

where you or your civilization stands compared to your rivals.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Palace:</b> As your population grows, the people spontaneously expand

of the palace to add to it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the available parts then displayed, select the one you wish to
have built. Palaces can be built in three styles: classical, medieval, or
Middle Eastern. A miniature rendition of your palace is shown in the
palace window of the map display.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Historians:</b> There are four historians who occasionally report on the
progress of the civilizations in your world. These repots are an
opportunity for you to judge how you are doing. The historians are
Herodotus, Pliny, Gibbon, and Toynbee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilizations may be judged in any of five categories, listed below.
The published list includes only the known civilizations, those with whom
you have established an embassy. However, all civilizations, known and
unknown, are considered in rankings. For example, if your civilization
has the third highest population but the larger civilizations are not
known, you would appear at the top of the list, but shown as number three
in the world. The five categories and how they are ranked follow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Advancement:</b> The number of technology advancements each civilization
has acquired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Happiness:</b> The number of happy people in each civilization's cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Power:</b> The total of the attack and defense factors of each
civilization's military units.

spaceship is the first to reach Alpha Centauri you can receive a bonus
score. This is 50 points per 10,000 colonists sent, multiplied by the
success rate of your mission. For example, if your spaceship arrives with
10,000 colonists and the success percentage of your expedition was 80%,

Each square consists of a unique type of terrain. Each type of terrain
has its own economic usefulness, effect on movement, and effect on
combat. Detailed information about terrain types is available from the
Terrain Chart in the Technical Notes section or in the Civilopedia.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic usefulness of the various terrains is important when
selecting city sites. The terrain that is close to a city produces food,
resources, and trade the city needs to grow and be productive. Some
terrain types are more valuable than others. Some may be irrigated or
mined for increased economic value, and others may be converted into
another type of terrain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When selecting sites for new cities, consider the terrain types
within the radius of the prospective city. The best city sites offer
immediate food, resources, and trade production, plus the potential for
long term development.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief description of the terrain types follows.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Arctic:</b> Frozen glaciers of ice and snow found near the north and
south poles. No food, resources, or trade can be obtained here.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Desert:</b> Very dry region that can be developed to be marginally
productive. Some resources are present that can be mined, food can be
produced if the desert is irrigated, and roads generate some trade.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Grassland:</b> These open lands have especially thick topsoils making
them excellent food producing areas. Food production can be increased by
irrigation. Roughly half of the Grasslands also have some resources,
making them excellent city sites. Grasslands may be converted into
Forests for increased resource production.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hills:</b> An area of rolling hills that offers easy access to
minerals, sources of water, pastures, and some possibility for
agriculture. When mined, Hills produce excellent resources. They also
produce some food and can be irrigated if necessary. Irrigating Hills
allows the irrigation to pass on to further squares that may be
otherwise cut off from water.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jungle:</b> These areas of forest and dense jungle produce relatively
poor amounts of food and no resources. But they can be made much more
valuable by conversion into either Grasslands or Forest. For this
reason, the long term potential of a city site containing several
Jungles is good.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mountains:</b> This very rugged terrain can only produce a small amount
of resources but this can be increased by mining. Mountains make the
best defensive terrain, but the production is so low that they make a
poor economic choice for the site of a city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ocean:</b> Oceans produce small amounts of food, but substantial trade.
Only ships or aircraft can enter Oceans. Landlocked Oceans are really
lakes but are treated like other Oceans in all respects.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plains:</b> These open areas differ from Grasslands in having poorer
soil but better resources of timber and minerals. They are poor food
producers unless irrigated. Due to the presence of resources, they make
good choices for city sites. Plains may be converted into forests.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rivers:</b> Rivers are great sites for starting cities and
civilizations dues to the richness of riverbank soils and natural trade
routes for boats. Rivers are as good as Grasslands for producing food
and always generate trade. River terrain may be irrigated to increase
food production. It was no accident that the first civilizations sprang
up along rivers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Swamp:</b> These coastal wetlands and flooded interior lands produce
only a small quantity of food. Like Jungles, however, they can be
converted into Grasslands or Forest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tundra:</b> These sparse lands of permafrost produce only a small
amount of food from grazing animals. There is no agriculture or use for
irrigation. These areas cannot be converted to other terrain and make
very poor city sites.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Forest:</b> These woodlands produce a modest mixture of food and
resources. If more food production is needed in the area, they can be
converted into plains.</font></td></tr>

to their economic value. The location of these resources is marked by
distinct symbols that are uncovered as the map is explored. More
detailed information about special resources can be found on the Terrain
Chart in the Technical Notes section or under the entry for their base
terrain in the Civilopedia. A brief description of the special resources
follows.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Coal (Hills):</b> Coal deposits represent rich sites of coal or metal
ores, which yield greatly increased resources, especially when mined.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fish (Ocean):</b> Fish represent the location of underwater banks and
reefs where currents and nutrients create excellent fishing grounds.
Fishing banks produce increased amounts of food.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Game (Forest and Tundra):</b> The presence of game indicates excellent
food sources available or the potential for good grazing. Game areas
produce additional food, but cannot be improved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gems (Jungle):</b> Gems indicate the presence of precious stones,
ivory, spices, salt, or other valuable commodities. These are good trade
items and therefore generate substantial trade from the area.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gold (Mountain):</b> Gold represents a bonanza of gold or silver. The
value of these deposits produces tremendous trade.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Horses (Plains):</b> Horses represent an increase in resources from
this area due to the benefits of using domesticated animals such as the
horse or oxen to do work. For all but the most recent periods of
history, animals were an important source of lifting and pulling power.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Oasis (Desert):</b> The oasis is a very fertile island in the desert
that takes advantage of the presence of some water and rich local
nutrients. The result is an area that produces substantial quantities of
food.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Oil (Swamp):</b> Oil represents the presence of mineral wealth,
especially petroleum. The result is a substantial quantity of resources.
Oil resources cannot be improved by mining.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note:</b> If you convert terrain containing a special resource into
another terrain type, the original special resource is lost. In some
cases a special resource that can be found in the new terrain may
appear.</font></td></tr>

control the movement and combat of units throughout the world, monitor
the moves and development of other civilizations, and summon the reports
of advisors. From the map display you can examine he known geography of
any part of your empire and those of your rivals. The map display
consists of six parts: the map window, the world window, the menu bar,
the palace window, the status report, and the unit identification
window.</font></td></tr>

in detail. Here you can examine the terrain, control the movements of
units, scout sites for new cities, and prepare war plans.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your civilization is just getting started, most of the world
is unknown. The map is covered and hidden from view. As your units move
and explore, the hidden areas are discovered and the map fills in. It is
useful to uncover the world quickly to find good areas for expansion,
absorb any minor tribes nearby, locate opposing civilizations, and
determine likely avenues of approach by enemies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways to quickly change maps and otherwise
look at different parts of the world. These are described below.
(Interface controls are explained for using a mouse with an IBM system.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Change Maps:</b> You can quickly scroll around the world changing the
map visible in the map display. (On the IBM, click the LMB on any
visible map square and the map scrolls, centering on the square you
selected.) See the section World Window below for another way to quickly
change maps.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Center on Unit:</b> You can center the map on the unit now waiting for
orders (blinking), regardless of where it is in the world. If the
waiting unit is not visible, the map scrolls so that the unit appears
centered. Press the Center key. (On the IBM, press the C key.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Find City:</b> You can center the map on any known city in the world.
Pull down the Game menu from the menu bar and choose the option "Find
City." Type in the name of the city and press Return (on the IBM). The
map scrolls and centers on the city. If you have not yet discovered the
location of a city, nothing happens when you try to find it using this
method.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that you do not need to type in the entire name of the city,
just enough letters to distinguish it from any other city in the world.</font></td></tr>

entire world. It is centered on the part of the world currently shown in
the map window. A box is positioned on this world map (colored white on
the IBM) to show what part is now visible in the map window.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days of your civilization, while most of the map is
still unknown, the world window is of little help in showing where you
are located in relation to other islands and continents. Because this
window centers on the map display, if most of the world is hidden, you
cannot know where the polar caps are or even what hemisphere you occupy.
You may be quite near one of the polar caps but not know it. After some
exploration, you can better judge your location and that of your rivals.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Map Scrolling:</b> You can use the world window to speed the scrolling
of the map display. (On the IBM, place the mouse pointer in the map
window and click the LMB. The world window shifts and the map window
scrolls to center on the position you pointed to.)</font></td></tr> 

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Menu Bar</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The menu bar is found across the top of the map display. From here
orders may be passed to units and various reports from advisors may be
summoned. There are five menus available: Game, Orders, Advisors, World,
and civilopedia.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orders menu lists any special commands that can be given to the
unit waiting for orders, in addition to normal movement commands.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisors and World menus have special reports that can be
requested from your various advisors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civilopedia menu gives access to the on-line encyclopedia of
<i>Civilization</i>. Use this to quickly obtain information on many different
topics such as technology advances, military units, military units,
terrain, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The options available from the Game menu are the following.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Revolution!:</b> To change your civilization's type of government, you
must have a revolution. The government goes into Anarchy for a few turns
and a new type of government may be chosen. You must have acquired
specific technologies to choose a government other than Despotism.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tax Rate:</b> The trade that cities generate arrives as luxury goods,
tax revenue, and new ideas (technology research). Here you can change
the percentage that becomes tax revenue. See trade rates below or more
information.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Luxury Rate:</b> Change the percentage of trade brought in as Luxury
goods. See Trade Rates below for more information.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Find City:</b> Choose this to locate a city in the world. Type in the
name of the city you wish to find. The map window centers on the city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Options:</b> Choose this menu option to turn on or off some game
features. Features available are Instant Advice, Autosave, End of Turn,
and Animations. A check mark next to the feature indicates that it is
on. Choosing an option that is on turns it off and vice versa.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Instant Advice</i> provides some helpful hints for new players. The
<i>Autosave</i> feature automatically saves your game every 50 turns. When <i>End
of Turn</i> is on, a message reports the end of each turn and must be
cleared for the game to continue. If you have no active units, this
message appears whether toggled on or off. <i>Animations</i> may be on or off.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Save Game:</b> Choosing this option stops play to save your game. (On
the IBM, follow the prompts for entering the drive where you wish the
game to be saved.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Retire:</b> Ends the history of the civilization you now rule,
calculating your score. If the score is high enough, you may enter the
Hall of Fame. Note that your civilization is lost if not saved first.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Quit:</b> End the history of the civilization you rule. No score is calculated and your civilization is lost if not saved first.</font></td></tr>

facts concerning the status of your civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Date:</b> The date is reported in years plus the notation BC or AD. The
normal game begins in 4000 BC. Each turn represents the passing of so
many years, depending on the current date.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Treasury:</b> The amount of cash in your treasury.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Population:</b> The size of your civilization's population.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Trade Rates:</b> The three numbers separate by periods are your trade
rates. The first number is the percentage of your trade that provides
luxuries. The second rate is the percentage that becomes tax revenue
added to the treasury. The third rate is the percentage put towards new
ideas to help learn new technology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxury goods are cultural pleasures like music, art, sports, and
the theater that people enjoy when they have leisure time. The more
luxuries that can be provided, the more happy citizens in your cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax revenue goes into the treasury and is needed to maintain
existing city improvements. Excess taxes over maintenance needs
accumulate in the treasury and can be spent later. Taxes, especially
high ones, tend to make the people unhappy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more new ideas and scientific research accomplished, the faster
new technology is acquired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the three by-products of trade has its benefits. As time
passes and cities grow, you may have to adjust the trade rates often to
provide a minimum amount of taxes and science research while keeping the
population content as a whole. To adjust trade rates, pull down the Game
menu and choose either the Tax Rate or Luxury Rate option. By setting
these two rates, the science rate is set by default.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>New Ideas:</b> This scientific research indicator, shaped like a light
bulb, shows how near you are to making a civilization advance. The
nearer you get, the more the light bulb fills in (yellow on the IBM).
When the bulb is full (bright yellow), it is on, indicating that you
have acquired a new technology. Once the idea is reported and your
scientists are sent off to study something else, the light bulb is
turned off. As your scientists progress, it gradually turns on again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Environment:</b> The environment indicator is the sun, and its color
shows how great is the risk of global warming. When there is no risk of
global warming, the sun indicator is not present. With the first case of
pollution, the sun indicator appears (colored dark red on the IBM). If
pollution continues, the color gradually changes (on the IBM to light
red, yellow, and then white). If pollution is not brought under control
when the indicator is brightest (white on the IBM), the planet suffers a
bout of global warming and then the indicator reverts to a cooler color
reflecting the new equilibrium.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollution and environmental problems can also be caused by nuclear
reactor meltdowns and fallout from nuclear weapons.</font></td></tr>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following information is shown.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nationality:</b> The name of the civilization to which the unit

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Unit type:</b> The type of unit and whether it is a veteran or not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Movement:</b> The number of movement points the unit has remaining. If
you are finished moving a unit that has movement left, press the No
Movement key (the Spacebar on the IBM) to skip to the next unit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that points are shown in thirds after the decimal point when
moving along Roads because Roads triple movement. For example, a unit
that begins with 1 movement point and moves one square along a Road
would be shown with .2 movement points remaining.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, units beginning on a square containing a Railroad and moving
along the Railroad spend no movement points.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Home City:</b> The name of the city that is supporting the unit and
normally the city where it was built. You may transfer a unit to another
city by moving it there and pressing the Home City key (the H key on the
IBM). This may be useful when one of your cities is threatened with
capture because all units supported by a captured city are destroyed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Terrain:</b> The terrain type of the square the unit is in. This
terrain report disregards the presence of a city but does mention other
improvements such as irrigation, roads, railroads, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Other Units:</b> At the bottom of this window are shown any friendly

parties of Settlers looking to found new cities, Diplomats, and Caravans
seeking to establish trade routes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the years a majority of your time is spent moving and
positioning armies. A strong military is required first for defense
against rivals and barbarians. They are also the eyes of your
civilization, exploring the world as they move. They can also serve you
by defeating armies of your rivals and conquering their cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armies can be ground military units (Legions, Cannons, and Armor
for example), naval units (Triremes, Ironclads, Battleships, etc.), or
air units (Fighters and Bombers). Also available are four special units:
Settlers, Diplomats, Caravans and Nuclear units. All unit types
available are described in the Civilopedia section Military Units.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After founding your first city, you may have the technology to
build only two types of unit, Militia and Settlers. As your civilization
acquires new technology, additional types become available for building.
All new units that appear at the city where they are constructed and are
available to be moved from that point.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All units and Settlers have an <i>attack factor</i> (A), <i>defense factor</i>
(D), and <i>movement factor</i> (M). The attack and defense factors indicate
the army's relative strength when attacking and defending. The movement
factor indicates how far the unit may move. In addition to moving and

unit waiting for orders blinks on the map. There are several order
options available: move the unit across the map up to the limit of its
movement factor, skip the unit if you prefer to move it later in the
turn, or have it do nothing this turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition you may order most units to fortify or go on sentry
duty. Fortified or sentry units no longer require orders. In future
turns they carry on and do not blink, waiting for orders. If you wish to
move these units later, they must be activated individually.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Moving Units:</b> Units may be moved up to the limit of their movement
factor. The cost to enter a map square depends on the terrain. Roads and
Railroads speed the movement of ground units. When a unit is unable to
complete a movement order because it does not have enough movement points
to proceed, its movement is finished for the turn. The map then centers
on the next unit waiting for orders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(On the IBM, units are moved across the map by using numeric keypad
keys 1-9, but not 5. Units may be moved in any of eight directions
corresponding to these eight outside keys. For example, pressing
the 2 key moves the unit one square towards the bottom of the map.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Skipping Units:</b> To skip a unit temporarily, press the Wait key (the
W key on the IBM). This passes you on to other units waiting for orders
and returns you to the skipped unit after all others have had a chance
to move.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>No Movement:</b> To order a unit not to move, press the No Movement key
(the Space Bar on the IBM). The map centers on the next unit needing
orders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Activating Units:</b> Fortified units and those on sentry duty must be
activated to receive movement orders. (On the IBM, place the mouse
pointer on the square and click the left mouse button. This opens a menu
displaying all units in the square. Click again on the icon of any unit
you wish to activate.) Fortified or sentry units within a city must be
activated from the city display. Sentry units are also activated when
enemy units move adjacent to them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Movement Restrictions:</b> Ground units (all non-ship, air, or nuclear
units) normally move only on land. They may move over sea squares, but
only by naval transport (see below). Ships may not enter squares
entirely made up of land except cities that are on the coast. Air units
may move over land and sea squares, but must land on a friendly city
square or Aircraft Carrier unit to refuel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ground units may not move from one square adjacent to an enemy army
or city directly to another such square.</i> The prohibited square may be
adjacent to the first enemy army, another army (even one from another
civilization), or any enemy city. Ground units may move into such a
controlled square if a friendly unit is already there. Air units, ship
units, Diplomats and Caravans ignore these restrictions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Naval Transport:</b> Ground units may be carried over sea squares only
by Triremes, Sails, Frigates, or Transports. Refer to the Civilopedia
for specific information about these ship units.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units may load onto a ship by moving onto it from an adjacent land
square. Also, units on sentry duty in a city with a ship automatically
load when the ship leaves. Units aboard ship are on sentry duty.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units may unload when activated by the normal method of activation
or by pressing the Unload key when the transporting ship is blinking.

square occupied by a unit of another civilization. When this happens a
battle is immediately resolved, resulting in the destruction of one army
or the other. When more than one unit is in the defender's square, the
unit with the highest defense strength defends. If it loses, then all
other armies stacked with it are destroyed as well. Successful attackers
that have a full movement point remaining after combat may continue to
move normally.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important factors in combat are the attack and defense
strengths of the combatants, the presence of veterans, the terrain
occupied by the defender, and any defensive improvements in the square.
After all of these factors are considered, the combat is resolved as a
simple calculation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a chariot (attack factor 4) attacks a phalanx
(defense factor 2), the Chariot has a 67% chance of winning (4 out of 6) and the Phalanx 33% (2 out of
6). If both units were veterans, the odds are 6 to 3. If both are
veterans and the Phalanx was behind City Walls (which triples the
defense factor), the odds are 6 to 9.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shore bombardments, city attacks, nuclear attacks, and bribing
enemy armies are special types of combat.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Attack Strength:</b> The basic attack strength of all armies. This full
strength is brought to bear so long as the army has at least one movement
factor remaining from movement. Armies with less movement available may
still attack but are penalized. Armies with high movement rates may make
several attacks each turn at full strength.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Defense Strength:</b> The basic defense strength of all armies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Veteran Status:</b> Veteran armies have their attack and defense
strengths increased by 50% before any other modification. Armies become
veterans when built at cities containing the Barracks improvement, or
they may become veterans after winning a battle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Terrain:</b> Many of the world terrain types increase the strength of
defenders. See the Terrain entries in the Civilopedia or the Terrain
Chart in the Technical Supplement for details.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fortified Armies:</b> Ground armies may fortify themselves, increasing
their defense strength by 50%. An army that has any movement points
remaining may be ordered to fortify on any land square by pressing the
Fortify key (the F key on the IBM).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Improvements:</b> Armies within a Fortress have their strength doubled
after all other modifications. Armies inside a city with City Walls are
tripled in strength. Cities protected by City Walls do not suffer
population losses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Attacking Cities:</b> When a defender in a city is destroyed by ground
attack, other defending units present are not destroyed. However, the
population of the city is reduced by one point unless the city is
protected by City Walls. Population loss does not occur due to naval or
air attack, but is affected by nuclear attack.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shore Bombardments:</b> Naval units with attack factors, other than
Submarines, may attack enemy armies on adjacent land squares, including
cities. Naval units in cities may defend against attack.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nuclear Attacks:</b> Nuclear attacks occur when a Nuclear units
attempts to enter a square occupied by enemy units or an enemy city. In
either case, all units, regardless of civilization, in the target square
and adjacent squares are destroyed. In addition, a city loses half of
its population. Nuclear attack can only be stopped by the presence of an
SDI Defense improvement in a city.</font></td></tr>

combat caused by movement). Settlers and Diplomats may be given unique
orders explained later.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Go To:</b> Orders an army to proceed to a destination square as fast as
it can. The army continues moving turn after turn until it arrives.
Press the Go To key (the G key on the IBM), and then designate the
destination square. (On the IBM, point to the square with the mouse
pointer and press the LMB.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Home City:</b> Orders a unit to change its home city. Move the unit to
the desired new home and press the Home key (the H key on the IBM). Air
units in flight may use this key to move to the nearest friendly city.
Press the Home key while the unit is in flight and it immediately moves
to the nearest friendly city or Aircraft Carrier. If the air unit does
not have enough movement remaining to reach the nearest base, it crashes
instead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sentry Duty:</b> A unit on sentry duty is marked by a faded icon on the
map. It no longer blinks each turn waiting for new orders. Sentry units
are activated as explained above. Sentry units automatically board any
transport ship that leaves a city they occupy. To put an army on sentry
duty, press the Sentry key (the S key on the IBM).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disband:</b> This order disbands the unit receiving it, removing the
unit from the map and city records. To disband a unit, press the Disband
key (the Shift + D keys on the IBM).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Pillage:</b> The first time this order is given, any terrain
improvements (irrigation or mines) are destroyed. Further pillage in the
square destroys railroads, if present, and then roads. For example, it
takes three turns of pillaging to remove all Improvements from an
irrigated square containing a railroad. To pillage, press the pillage
key (the Shift + P keys on the IBM).</font></td></tr> 

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Settlers</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlers are groups of your most resourceful and adventurous
citizens. As independent pioneers they perform two critical functions
for your civilization: they found new cities and serve as engineers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>New Cities:</b> To found a new city, move a Settler to the desired
location and press the Build key (the B key on the IBM). The Settler
disappears because the people is represents have become the population
of the new city. However, in the future the new city can be ordered to
produce more Settlers that can be used to found additional cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Build order can also be used to grow an existing city. Move a
Settler into an existing city and press the Build key. The Settler is
absorbed into the city, adding one point to its population. This may be
useful when one city is limited in its ability to expand. This city can
be used to produce Settlers who migrate to a larger more useful city
where the Settlers can be put to work. However, Settlers may not be
added to cities that already contain ten population points or more.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Settler Engineers:</b> Settlers can make a number of agricultural and
industrial improvements for your civilization, acting as engineers.
Place the Settler in the square where the work is to be done and press
the correct key (see the box below). Note that your civilization must
possess certain improvements can be built.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Diplomats</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diplomats are unique units that can be very useful to your
civilization. They may act as trade missions, ambassadors, envoys,
secret agents, and saboteurs. They can open contacts with other
civilizations and establish embassies to gather information about your
rivals. They can act as spies, stealing information and otherwise
disrupting your rivals. They can bribe enemy armies. When your
civilization obtains the technology of Writing you can build Diplomats.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that enemy Diplomats can be used against your civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Diplomat Movement:</b> Diplomats may move past enemy armies without
stopping. However, if any enemy military unit enters the square occupied
by the Diplomat, the Diplomat is always destroyed. Diplomats may travel
overseas as other armies do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diplomats (and Caravans) are the only units that can enter defended
enemy cities. When a Diplomat enters an enemy city a menu appears
listing tasks that can be performed:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspect City <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish Embassy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steal Technology
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Sabotage
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incite A Revolt
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet With King
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inspect City:</b> This opens the enemy's city display. You can see what
armies are defending it and what improvements have been made. When you
clear the city screen (press the Return key or either mouse button on
the IBM), you return to the map display but your diplomat has been
eliminated.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Establish Embassy:</b> This Diplomat establishes official contact with
the other civilization and continually reports thereafter its type of
government, treasury, the name of its capital city, treaties with other
civilizations, states of war, and technology advances the Diplomat
uncovers. Lists by historians of outstanding civilizations only include
those with whom you have established embassies. It is only necessary to
establish an embassy once with any civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Steal Technology:</b> Your Diplomat steals one technology advance from
the other civilization. This can only be done once per city and your
Diplomat disappears in the process (his cover is blown). If you have
already stolen from this city, the Diplomat loses its turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Industrial Sabotage:</b> Your Diplomat destroys either the item
currently under production by the city or one of the city's
improvements. You cannot control what is destroyed. The Diplomat is lost
in the effort. Destroying a critical improvement may throw the city into
unrest (Temple, Cathedral), weaken its defenses (City Walls), or cut its
production (Factory). Diplomats never destroy Wonders of the World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Incite a Revolt:</b> Your Diplomat contacts dissidents within a city
and for a suitable payment the city revolts and joins your civilization.
The payment to revolt depends on the size of the city and its proximity
to the civilization's capital. Also, a city in civil disorder revolts
for less. Your Diplomat is lost in a successful revolt but escapes
outside the city if you refuse to pay the cost. The revolt also fails
and your Diplomat survives if you don't have enough cash. Enemy capitals
do no revolt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Meet With King:</b> Your Diplomat opens negotiations with the enemy
ruler. This may lead to offers for trading technology or for making
treaties. Your Diplomat is not lost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bribing Enemy Units:</b> You may convince an enemy unit to defect and
join your civilization by moving a Diplomat into its square. A menu
appears showing how much the army demands to defect. If you accept, the
cash is deducted from your treasury, the army switches over, and the
Diplomat survives. If you fail to make the payment, the Diplomat left on
deposit is lost. When more than one enemy unit is in a square, bribery
is not possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest friendly city becomes the home city for a newly bribed
unit.</font></td></tr>
 
<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Caravans</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caravans are shipments of trade goods and materials. Over time they
represent camel caravans, wagon trains, truck convoys, and cargo
containers. They may be used to establish trade routes between cities or
to transfer resources for the construction of Wonders of the World. They
become available once you have achieved the technology of Trade.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Trade Routes:</b> A Caravan that enters any city of another
civilization or a friendly city ten or more squares away from its home
city may establish a trade route. This results in an immediate cash
payment for delivery plus an increase in trade generated each turn. This
increased trade means more luxuries, taxes, and science for the home
city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each city may have up to three functioning trade routes. If more
than three are established only the best three function.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of trade generated depends partly on the size of the two
cities. Bigger cities generate more trade. Trade is best with a city in
another civilization. Next best are friendly cities. The farther apart
the two cities are, the greater the value of trade. The value is also
increased when the cities are on different continents.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caravans can move into any city they can reach. When at war it may
be difficult to smuggle goods into an enemy city without being
destroyed. Caravans may be transported overseas in ships as other units
are, but cannot be landed into an enemy city directly from a ship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Building Wonders:</b> A Caravan may contribute its construction cost in
resources to the cost of building any Wonder of the World by moving the
Caravan into the city where the Wonder is being built. When the Caravan
enters, a menu offers the choice of contributing to the construction or
not. If you decide to help build the Wonder, the Caravan disappears and
the resources needed to build it are added to the production of the
Wonder, speeding its completion.</font></td></tr> 

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Military Units</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are the military units that can be built by your
civilization. There is a brief description of each unit, including any
special abilities. The three numbers shown after the unit's name are its
attack, defense, and movement factors. In parentheses after the name is
shown the advance required before each unit can be built. In brackets is
shown the number of resources it takes to build each unit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Armor 10-5-3 (the Automobile) [80]:</b> a group of tanks or other
armored fighting vehicles. Due to its high attack factor and speed,
Armor is one of the best units for conducting ground campaigns.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Artillery 12-2-2 (Robotics) [60]:</b> a group of self-propelled, heavy
caliber artillery pieces. Defenders are not tripled behind City Walls
when attacked by Artillery because the guns fire over the walls.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Battleship 18-12-4 (Steel) [160]:</b> a heavily armored and gunned
warship. Battleships have a visibility range of two sea squares and may
conduct shore bombardments. They may not carry ground units.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bomber 12-1-8(16) (Advanced Flight) [120]:</b> a group of long-range
aircraft designed to carry and drop bombs. Bombers may stay airborne for
one turn but must return safely to a base (a friendly city or Carrier) by
the end of the second turn. They have a visibility of two squares over
any terrain. Bombers ignore City Walls in the same manner as Artillery.
They may only be attacked by Fighters. Other units may not enter a
square occupied by a Bomber, so they are useful for interdicting enemy
movement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cannon 8-1-1 (Metallurgy) [40]:</b> a group of carriage-mounted,
smooth-bore cannons. Cannons are excellent units on the attack and their
arrival often opens a new round of offensive wars, especially when
accompanied by Riflemen who can stack with them for defense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Carrier 1-12-5 (Advanced Flight) [160]:</b> an aircraft carrier is
capable of acting as a base for Bombers, Fighters, and Nuclear units.
Carriers may carry up to eight air units and have a visibility of two
sea squares.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Catapult 6-1-1 (Mathematics) [40]:</b> a group of siege weapons
designed to throw rocks and other materials with great force. Useful in
the defense and attack of cities, but are weak when left alone on
defense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cavalry 2-1-2 (Horseback Riding) [20]:</b> a unit of mounted soldiers.
Cavalry are useful as scouts and raiders because of their speed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chariot 4-1-2 (the Wheel) [40]:</b> a group of light carriages,
normally mounted on two wheels and each carrying a driver and warrior.
Chariots are a powerful weapon on the attack but very weak on defense.
They are also useful as scouts because of their speed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cruiser 6-6-6 (Combustion) [80]:</b> a very fast and moderately
powerful warship. Cruisers have a visibility of two sea squares and may
conduct shore bombardment. They may not carry ground
units.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fighter 4-2-10 (Flight) [60]:</b> a squadron of fighter aircraft.
Fighters are useful as scouts and for attacking enemy Bombers. Fighters
must return to a friendly base by the end of each turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Frigate 2-2-3 (Magnetism) [40]:</b> a fast sailing warship armed with a
substantial number of guns. Frigates may carry up to four ground units.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ironclad 4-4-4 (Steam Engine) [60]:</b> a fast, steam-powered ship
armored with iron plating. Ironclads may not carry other units.
Ironclads are most useful for attacking enemy ships and less so for
conducting shore bombardments.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Knights 4-2-2 (Chivalry) [40]:</b> a group of armored warriors mounted
on large powerful horses. Knights are often a useful combination of
speed, defensive strength, and offensive strength.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Legion 3-1-1 (Iron Working) [20]:</b> a well-trained force of infantry
armed with shields, short swords, and throwing spears. Legions are good
offensive units that are relatively inexpensive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mechanized Infantry 6-6-3 (Labor Union) [50]:</b> a group of modern
infantry mounted on armored vehicles like the Bradley. Mechanized
Infantry is the best defensive ground unit in the game, useful for
defending cities or other important points. It also has a good attack
factor and excellent speed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Militia 1-1-1 (-) [10]:</b> a band of citizens armed with crude
weapons, mostly tools and farm implements. Militia are normally the only
military unit that you can build when starting a civilization and are
only a stopgap until better units become available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Musketeers 2-3-1 (Gunpowder) [30]:</b> a company of infantry armed with
muskets. Due to their higher defense factor, Musketeers are useful for
replacing Phalanxes in positions that need to be defended.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nuclear 99-0-16 (Rocketry &amp; Nuclear Fission) [160]:</b> a missile
weapon armed with a nuclear warhead. A Nuclear unit can only be built
after the Manhattan project has been built somewhere in the world. A
Nuclear unit may move between cities and Carriers. It is lost if it does
not end its turn in a city or on a Carrier, and does not attack. It
explodes when it attacks an enemy unit or city. A nuclear attack
destroys all military units in the target square and adjacent squares,
regardless of who they belong to. Nuclear attacks may also destroy city
populations and cause pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Phalanx 1-2-1 (Bronze Working) [20]:</b> a company of infantry armed
with long pikes and very strong on the defensive. Phalanxes are very
good food defending cities and other important points early on. No other
type of unit is as cost effective for defense until Musketeers become
available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Riflemen 3-5-1 (Conscription) [30]:</b> a company of infantry armed
with rifles. Riflemen are excellent defenders of cities and other
points, and useful for replacing Phalanxes and Musketeers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sail 1-1-3 (Navigation) [40]:</b> a small ship powered by sails and
lightly armed. Sailing Ships may carry up to three other units by naval
transport. They are very useful for exploring the oceans because they
are not restricted to staying near the coasts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Submarine 8-2-3 (Mass Production) [50]:</b> a warship designed to
attack from underwater by firing torpedoes at enemy ships on the
surface. Submarines have a visibility of two sea squares and can only be
spotted by enemy ships when adjacent. They may not carry ground units or
conduct shore bombardment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Transport 1-0-3 (Map Making) [40]:</b> a small ocean-going ship powered
by oars. Triremes are lost at sea approximately half of the time when
they are not adjacent to land at the end of a turn. They are normally
the first ship that becomes available, and are thus very useful for
exploring the sea and transporting Diplomats, Caravans, and other units
to nearby continents.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Barbarians</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbarians are small tribes of raiders that are not part of any
opposing civilization. (For the IBM version, they are always red units.)
You may encounter them periodically as your civilization begins to
expand and grow. They may invade from the sea or arise suddenly in
unsettled parts of any continent. Barbarians may attempt to capture or
destroy your cities, and pillage your fields and mines.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because barbarians may appear along any coast or in any unsettled
area, it is important to defend cities. It way also be useful to screen
your cities from unsettled areas so that barbarians that appear may be
intercepted before they reach your cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most barbarian tribes are accompanied by a leader who may be
ransomed if captured. Barbarian leaders look like Diplomats.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sea Raiders:</b> Barbarians that invade from the sea are looking for a
place to settle. They search for cities and attempt to capture them.
They do not pillage mines and irrigation because of their interest in
making a permanent settlement. If they capture a city, they take it over
and begin producing more units to make new assaults. Sea raiders can be
fought on land or engaged at sea in their ships.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Land Barbarians:</b> These raiders are interested only in loot, not
permanent settlements. This makes them very harmful as they pillage any
mines or irrigation they encounter. If they capture one of your cities,
they utterly destroy it. For these reasons, land barbarians are best
engaged as far from your cities as possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land barbarians arise in areas that are not within the radius of a
city. As time passes they appear at even farther distances from
civilization. Thus, expanding your cities over a continent eventually
removes the threat of barbarians appearing because the entire area has
become more or less civilized by the presence of your cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ransoming Barbarian Leaders:</b> If a barbarian leader is alone in a
square and you attack him and win, he is captured and immediately
ransomed for 100 coins. The money is added to your treasury. When
barbarian units are attacked and destroyed, leader units stacked with
them are destroyed also. Barbarian leaders who have lost their armies
attempt to escape and disappear if not captured in a few turns.</font></td></tr>

of government. There are six types of government possible but the ones
available to you at any moment depend on the technology that your
civilization has achieved. One type of government, Anarchy, only occurs
under a special circumstance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When beginning a new game your civilization is automatically
governed by Despotism. The additional types become available when the
specific civilization advance bearing their name is made. (An exception
is the Pyramids Wonder of the World.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different types of government each have their own unique
effects. Some allow greater personal and economic freedom resulting in
fast growing trade, science, and economies, while others are better

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despotism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Despotism:</b> You rule by absolute power. The people just have enough
to live with it because your will is enforced by the army. Due to the
minimal amount of economic and personal freedom, production is at a
minimum, But your total control makes conducting war relatively easy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military units do not require resource support until the number of
units making this their home city (shown in the home city roster)
exceeds the number of people in the city. Each home military unit in
excess of the number of people in the city requires one unit of
resources for industrial support. Diplomats and Caravans do not require
support.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, any map square that produces three or more food,
resources, or trade has this production reduced by one. For example, a
mine normally producing three resources produces only two under
Despotism.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlers require one food for support.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Anarchy:</b> You have temporarily lost control of government. Cities
continue to operate on their own but some important operations of your
civilization come to a halt until control is restored. You are able to
continue controlling the movements of your units.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anarchy has the same effect as Despotism with several exceptions-
no tax revenue is collected, no maintenance is charged for city
improvements, and no scientific research is done while Anarchy
continues. Anarchy only occurs during revolutions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Monarchy:</b> Your rule is less absolute, and more with the acceptance
of the people, especially an aristocracy of upper class citizens. The
aristocratic classes at least have a certain amount of economic freedom
and this results in the potential for greater production of resources,
food, and trade. However, the upper classes deduct a share of your
civilization's production as maintenance for military units and luxuries
in the larger cities.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a Monarchy, there is no reduction of production in squares
that produce three or more units of food, resources, or trade.
Irrigation of Grasslands and Rivers, plus mining of Hills can now pay
off with increased production. All military units must be supported by
one unit of resources. Settlers require two food for support.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Communism:</b> You are the head of the communistic government, and rule
with the support of the controlling party. Although this form of
government allows more production than despotism, the orthodoxy of the
party restricts personal and economic freedom, limiting trade. However,
corruption is kept to a minimum by the action of the local party
apparatus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism has the same effect as Monarchy except that corruption is
flat. Instead of increasing the farther a city is located from the
Palace, all of your cities suffer the same rate of corruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Republic:</b> You rule over the assembly of city-states formed from
the cities that your civilization has established. Each city is an
autonomous state, yet also is part of the republic that you rule at
their request. They have a great deal of personal and economic freedom,
and this results in greatly increased trade. Your diplomacy is reviewed
by the Senate and they can override your decisions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasslands, Rivers, and Hills are as productive as they are under a
Monarchy. Also, an additional trade unit is generated wherever at least
one trade unit already exists. Military units each require one resource
for industrial support. Settlers require two food. Each military unit
not in its home city makes one citizen (one city population point)
unhappy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Senate of your government accepts any peace offer
made by another civilization, overriding even a desire for war by you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Democracy:</b> You rule as the elected executive of a democracy. The
people feel that you rule because they want you to. The degree of
freedom allowed under this government results in maximum opportunity for
economic production and trade. However, the people also have a very
strong voice in determining how much economic production is devoted to
improving the standard of living. As in a Republic, some diplomatic
decisions are subject to review by your Senate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy is very similar to The Republic. One difference is that
under Democracy there is no corruption. Also, if one or more of your
cities are in civil disorder for two turns, there is a chance each turn
thereafter that a revolution may occur. Each military unit not in its
home city makes two citizens unhappy.</font></td></tr>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demographics
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>City Status:</b> This report lists the cities in your civilization and
shows what they are producing. For each city you can read the population
size, the amount of food, resources, and trade generated, what item is
currently being produced, and how near it is to being completed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to consult this advisor at the beginning of your turn
to refresh your memory about what you are producing and how close it is
to completion. You can see at a glance whether some critical military
unit or Wonder of the World is nearly completed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Military Advisor:</b> The first military report shows how many units of
each type your civilization has in existence and is producing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear the screen to see the second part of the report (for the IBM,
press Return, the Spacebar, or any mouse button). This part of the report
shows the casualties that you have taken and inflicted in combat with
other civilizations. The casualties are shown by type and civilization.
Civilizations are differentiated by their color. For example, if one of
your rivals is the Aztecs, colored yellow, and there is a yellow "1" in
the Ironclad row, this indicates that you have destroyed one Aztec
Ironclad. Your casualties are shown in the first column in the left side.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Intelligence Advisor:</b> This report is a summary of information
gathered by your embassies. For each civilization with whom you have
established diplomatic relations, this report presents accurate data on
the name of their capital, their type of government, the size of their
treasury, and their diplomatic status with other civilizations. No
information appears for civilizations with whom you have not established
an embassy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can learn here which civilizations are at war and which are at
peace, and with whom. You may find it useful to consult this report
before attacking another civilization. For example, if two of your
neighbors are at war, you may consider yourself passing the opportunity
to attack one of them yourself. If you do attack, they may make peace
with each other and both attack you. By leaving them at war, you are free
to concentrate on your own progress while they wear each other down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second page of information may be called up by pressing the Info
button. (Click on the button with either mouse button on the IBM.) This
page reports some additional information regarding the apparent goals of
the civilization's leader and their most recent technological advances.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Attitude Advisor:</b> This advisor reports the relative happiness of
your citizens. From his survey you can see at a glance the number of
happy, content, and unhappy citizens in each of your cities. This
information can be very useful after changing your luxury rate or type of
government because those changes can have a significant effect on the
happiness of your citizens. By reviewing this survey you can quickly see
where you may have to make adjustments in city management to avoid
disorder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each of your cities, you see the current population and icons of
any city improvements that help increase the happiness of the people. At
the bottom of the page are totals for the size of the population and
percentages of the total that are happy, content, and unhappy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By examining the roster of improvements for each city, you may see
where a city is missing a helpful improvement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Trade Advisor:</b> Your trade advisor reports for each of your cities
how much of its trade is directed toward bringing in luxuries, tax
revenue, and new ideas (scientific research). The amount of luxuries,
taxes, and science a city is producing is shown to the right of its name.
Below the list of cities is a total for tax collections per turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right side of the report is a list of city improvements that
exist throughout your civilization. Only those improvements that cost
money for maintenance are listed. The report shows how many of each
improvement exist and the cost of maintaining them. At the bottom of this
list is the total of your improvement maintenance costs for this turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparing the tax revenue number with the maintenance cost
number, you can see whether the treasury of your civilization is
increasing each turn, shrinking, or remaining the same. If your treasury
is shrinking, this may be a good time to increase taxes or adjust
individual cities to produce higher revenue. In an emergency, you may
wish to sell an improvement to raise cash.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final item in the report is labeled "Discoveries" and shows the
number of turns needed for your scientists to acquire the technology
advance that you have directed them to seek. The more scientific research
done by your cities, the fewer turns required. Note that as technology
increases, it takes more and more research to make the next breakthrough.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Science Advisor:</b> Your science advisor keeps track of the
technologies that your civilization has already achieved and the progress
of your scientists towards their next advance. (In the IBM version,
technology that your civilization was first to learn is shown in white.)
A chart shows progress towards the next advance. The light bulbs indicate
how much research has been done. When the box if full of light bulbs, the
advance being researched is achieved.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to continue making advances beyond the basic list
that defines civilization up to the end of the 20th century. These
continuing advances are called Futuristic Advances and each one you
acquire adds 5 points to your civilization score.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wonders of the World:</b> Your geographers maintain a listing of the
location of the Wonders of the World. When they hear of the construction
of a new one they add it to the list. By the end of your civilization's
history, there may be as many as 21 Wonders: 7 ancient, 7 medieval, and 7
modern. Knowing where they are may be useful because capturing the city
where a Wonder is located adds to the glory of your civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geographer's list shows the Wonder's icon, its name, the city in
which it is located, and the civilization that built it. Clear the page
of ancient Wonders to see the medieval Wonders, and clear it again to see
the modern Wonders. (On the IBM clear the page by pressing the Return key
or either mouse button.) Note that only existing Wonders appear on the
list.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King's Advisors: The advisors that appear behind rival kings are
intended to indicate the government of the enemy civilization and its
relative size. A king with four advisors indicates that his civilization
is one of the largest in the world. A king with only one advisor
indicates a very small civilization. The dress of the advisors indicates
the civilization's type of government as follows. A government in Anarchy
is represented by the advisors of Despotism.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mongols - Ancient Despotism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egyptians - Ancient Monarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greeks - Ancient Republic/Democracy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans - Modern Republic/Democracy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoodlums - Modern Despotism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English - Modern Monarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soviets - Communism
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Top Five Cities:</b> This report graphically shows the five highest
rated cities in the world. The five cities are named and their parent
civilizations are also listed. Below the names are the population rosters
of the cities and the icons of any Wonders that have been built there.
All cities in the world are rated and the five with the highest scores
are put on the list. Cities score points as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 points: For each happy citizen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
 point: For each content citizen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10
 points: For each Wonder of the World built there
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that cities you have never discovered can be revealed to you in
this list. The magnificence of these cities has passed by word of mouth
to the corners of the world. Your geographers and other advisors
constantly sift the rumors of travelers and traders for information
regarding other civilizations. Even though some civilizations are not
known to you, the splendor of their cities has reached the ears of your
advisors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Civilization Score:</b> This is a relative measure of how your
civilization is doing. It is also totaled one last time when the game
ends to give you a final score for the game to see how you stand. Your
ultimate goal is to score over 1,000. Points are scored for the following
conditions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 points: For each happy citizen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
 point: For each content citizen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20
 points: For each Wonder of the World that you possess
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3
 points: For each turn of World peace (no wars)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5
 points: For each Futuristic advance
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-10
 points: For each map square currently polluted
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the report is a bar graph indicating how far you
have advanced towards a civilization score of 1,000.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>World Map:</b> Also the work of your geography department, this is a map
if the entire known world. Parts of the world that you have not
discovered cannot be seen. In addition, this map is centered horizontally
on your capital. Thus you cannot tell exactly where you are located
relative to the north and south polar boundaries until you discover them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spaceships:</b> When you contact your space advisors, they can report
the progress of any spaceship under construction. Select from the menu
the civilization whose spaceship you wish to examine. Your advisors
present a picture of the construction accomplished to date and their
assessment of what it can carry, its estimated flight time, and its
success probability.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space race begins once the Apollo Program Wonder of the World
has been constructed. Thereafter any civilization that has the required
technologies may begin building parts of a spaceship.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the space race begins, it is important to maintain watch on the
spaceships of your rivals. You need to assess when they are likely to
launch so you can plan the size of your own ship and its launch date. If
you conclude that your ship construction is too far behind to catch up,
it may be necessary to mount a military campaign to capture the enemy
capital. Capturing the enemy capital cancels the enemy spaceship under
construction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Demographics:</b> Your advisors keep track of demographic information
regarding your civilization in comparison to others in the world. This
information is available in this report. It details your civilization's
status in a number of areas and where it ranks in the world. Examining
this report may offer clues about which civilizations are your biggest
threats.</font></td></tr>

there is no chance of pollution.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city's population has no effect on pollution until you acquire

significant factor in the probability of pollution occurring.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a probability of pollution occurring at a city,
smokestacks begin appearing on the city display. The number of stacks

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of pollution throughout your civilization can be
monitored by watching the pollution indicator, a small sun in the date

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colors of the sun depend on the number of squares currently

coastal Forests may become Jungles. Plains, Grasslands, and Forests in
the interior may become Deserts. The result is much lower food, industry,

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your environmental advisors report immediately if global warming has
occurred. The effect is always bad, but in the case of flooded coastal
areas you may improve Jungles and Swamps over time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Causes:</b> Global warming may occur if at least nine map squares,
anywhere in the world, are currently polluted. If they are left
unattended for too long, environmental damage occurs.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nuclear Weapons:</b> When a nuclear unit is used in an attack, an
additional effect of the attack is the pollution of a number of map
squares around the impact square. Remember this when you are tempted to
use nuclear weapons. You may create pollution you cannot readily reach
with Settlers to clean up, significantly raising the risk of global
warming.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nuclear Meltdown:</b> If a nuclear Power Plant melts down, half of the

goes into civil disorder. The civilian unrest may result in safety
procedures becoming so lax that a catastrophic accident occurs. If you
build Nuclear Power Plants in any of your cities, take special care not
to allow those cities to go into disorder.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rival may contact you when units from each of your civilizations
are adjacent to each other. A rival envoy may also arrive at any time.
You may start negotiations by sending a Diplomat into a rival city and
selecting the option "Meet With the King."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone and result of any negotiations are greatly influenced by
the mood of your rival. The opposing leader may be antagonistic,
supplicating, or somewhere in between. This mood depends upon the
leader's personality and how your two civilizations compare to each other
and the rest of the world. You may be able to pick up cues on a rival's
mood from facial expressions or background music.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rival leader's personality may be aggressive, friendly, or
neutral.
Aggressive leaders are more likely to lean toward war or demand high
payments for peace. Friendly leaders are more likely to offer peace and
may only be bluffing when asking for payment. If you have broken previous
peace agreements with this civilization, that is remembered and also
influences the degree of antagonism.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are the largest, most powerful, and richest civilization in
the world, all rivals are likely to be very jealous or antagonistic.
However, if the opponent is puny in comparison, the natural tendency
toward being belligerent may be overridden. A civilization threatened
with extinction is more interested in survival.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All negotiations end with either an agreement of peace between your
two civilizations or a declaration of war. Even the most antagonistic
rival may concede peace for a suitable payment of cash or technology.
This may purchase peace only temporarily, however.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing embassies with other civilizations can be very useful
in preparation for negotiations. Your Intelligence Advisor collects
information from all your enemies and from him you can learn important
facts about your opponents, including their size and the personality of
their leader. This information is not available for civilizations with
which you have not established an embassy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,b&gt;Trading Technology: Civilizations that are not extremely
antagonistic may offer to trade technology. They may begin by offering
one that you don't possess. They may actually have several you lack. If
you agree, a menu of technologies they can trade appears. Select the one
that you want and then they take one from you. You have no choice
regarding what they take and cannot veto the trade. If after trading
another exchange is possible, more trading may take place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Buying Peace:</b> A rival may demand a cash payment or a civilization
advance during negotiation. If you meet this demand, the rival almost
certainly agrees to peace. If you reject the demand, an antagonistic
rival generally declares war. The demand of a more peaceful or threatened
rival may only be a bluff, and peace may be offered anyway after demands
are rejected. In some cases, a rival offers a reward for your making
peace or declaring war on another civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Post-Treaty Negotiations:</b> Once you agree to a peace treaty you have
an opportunity for further negotiations. A menu opens offering three
choices: a declaration of harmony, a military proposal, or a demand for
tribute. The declaration of harmony has no real effect. A military
proposal is a suggestion by you for your new friends to attack a third
party. This generally costs you a cash payment which you can pay or turn
down. The third option is a demand for tribute to cement the new treaty
you have signed. If your opponent is weak or in awe of your power, he may
pay. Alternatively, he may refuse to pay, or even go so far as to declare
war on you.</font></td></tr>

diplomacy. If you and your rival agree, then a state of peace can occur.
Choosing peace is voluntary unless your government is a Republic or
Democracy. In those cases the Senate of the government overrules any
decision for war and accepts peace.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace agreements can normally be broken at any time by either party,
but so long as it holds, both parties must adhere to the following rules:
units of the other civilization, even Diplomats, may not be attacked; no
units except Diplomats and Caravans may enter squares that have been
improved by the other party within the radius of a city (irrigated,
mined, or penetrated by roads); squares that the other party has under
development may not be pillaged; and technology may not be stolen from
the other party. Any of these events ends the peace and triggers war. You
are warned that you are about to break a peace and have a chance to check
your action.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your government is a Republic or Democracy, you may not
voluntarily violate a peace agreement. The Senate forbids any action that
starts war. If you consider war necessary, you must have a Revolution to
overthrow the government and put in one more receptive to your wishes.
Alternatively, you may wait for your opponent to break the peace himself
or declare war on you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are at peace it is much easier for trade Caravans to reach
the cities of the other party and establish trade routes. If the entire
world is at peace, your civilization score is increased. The major
benefit of peace is that you are not at war. During war, all of the proscribed activities are
possible and can cause great damage and waste of resources.</font></td></tr>

possible to another star system. To have any chance of success it must
provide at least a minimum of the following: living space for colonists,
food sources, energy sources, propulsion power, and fuel for the engines.
The better prepared the spaceship, the higher the number of colonists
that arrive safely and the faster the voyage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your goal is to build a spaceship that can hold as many colonists as
possible, yet travel at a reasonable speed and with a reasonable
probability of success. As construction of your ship proceeds, keep an
eye on its characteristics, displayed to the right of the spaceship
window. All spaceships have the same characteristics: population, food,
energy, mass, fuel, flight time, and probability of success.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have built a spaceship that meets the minimum requirements
for carrying colonists, you may launch or proceed with further
construction to increase the capacity of the ship.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Support:</b> The percentage of the people that the ship is prepared to
carry that can currently be supported. People that are not provided with
life support cannot be expected to survive the voyage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Energy:</b> The percentage of the energy required by the habitation and
life support modules that is currently being provided. If sufficient
energy is not provided for life support and habitation, the probability
of success will be very low.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mass:</b> All of the components, modules, and structures add to the mass
of your spaceship. The greater the mass, the more power required from
propulsion parts to move it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fuel:</b> The percentage of the fuel your propulsion units require that
is currently aboard. If insufficient fuel is provided, the propulsion
components aboard cannot work to their maximum power and the best
possible speed cannot be attained.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Flight Time:</b> A calculation of the number of years required for your
spaceship to reach the nearest star based on the ship's mass and engine
power. Adding more engines and fuel reduces flight time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Probability of Success:</b> The approximate percentage of the people
that can be carried that are expected to survive the voyage, based on the
amount of food and energy provided, plus the flight time. The faster the
flight, the higher the expected survival rate.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic and industrial centers of your civilization are its
cities. They are the residence of the population, the source of tax
dollars, the home of your scientists, and the sites of your industrial
production. Each city organizes the development of the area surrounding
it, converting the nearby agricultural land, natural resources, and
potential trade into food, industrial production, technology, and cash.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure of the success of your civilization is the number of
cities it encompasses and the size of each. Larger cities collect more
taxes, conduct more technology research, and produce new items faster.
Small civilizations, both in numbers of cities and the sizes of each,
risk being overrun by larger and more powerful neighbors. Falling too far
behind in the arms race, both in quality and quantity, may result in an
early exit from history.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of your civilization involves the founding of cities,
their management, and their protection. New cities can be built from
scratch or captured from rivals. Managing a city requires maintaining a
balance of food, industry, taxes, luxuries, and improvements that keeps
the citizens content and productive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rival civilizations are a constant threat to the security of your
cities. After taking steps to protect them, consider conquering cities of
your rivals. This reduces the threat they pose and is often an
inexpensive way to expand.

They can be started from
scratch, a minor tribe discovered by your armies may elect to join you as
a new city, or your armies can conquer the cities of your neighbors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Founding New Cities:</b> When a Settler unit is on a map square where
you wish to build a new city, press the Build key (the B key on the IBM).
You can accept a name your advisors propose for the new city or type in a
name you prefer. Enter the name when you are satisfied. (Press the Return

economic development can be arranged as desired. When the display is
closed, the new city is on the map and the Settler unit has disappeared,
having become the first citizens of the city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Minor Tribes:</b> As your armies explore the world they may encounter
minor tribes. Occasionally a minor tribe may be sufficiently awed by your
emissaries to immediately become part of your civilization. In this case,
the minor tribe forms a new city of your civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Capturing Cities:</b> Cities of other civilizations are normally
defended. If the defenders can be destroyed, a friendly army may move
into the city and capture it. A captured city is thereafter managed and
controlled by you in the same manner as any other city. Capturing an
enemy city may also result in the discovery of a new technology advance
and plundered cash.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupying an enemy city may destroy some improvements the city has
built, and it eliminates one point of population. Therefore, a city that
has only one point of population remaining is destroyed instead of
captured.

</font></td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Placing New Cities</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When building a new city, plan carefully where it is placed. The map
square in which it is built and the squares surrounding it determine how
valuable the city can become. Factors to be considered include the
economic value of the square the city is placed in, the economic
potential within the city's radius, the proximity of other cities, and
the strategic value of the location. Ideally, locate cities in areas that
offer a combination of food for population growth, resources for
production, and trade. Where possible, take advantage of the presence of
special resource squares.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The City Square:</b> The terrain the city occupies is especially
important because it is always under development. You cannot take workers
off of this square when adjusting development on the city map (see City
Map). If this area is not
useful. especially for producing food, then population growth in a new
city is handicapped. For this reason, new cities are generally built in
Plains, Grasslands, or Rivers. These provide the best food production
and, thus, faster population growth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The City Radius:</b> The potential area of development extends out from
a city two squares on the map in every direction except diagonally. If
the city grows large enough, its population can bring all of this area
into development. When planning a new city, consider this radius and the
long-term benefits of any potential site.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grow, the city must encompass sufficient food-growing areas. Any
city that can grow has value, but your most important cities are those
that also have resources available. These cities can quickly build and
support military units and Wonders. Hills and Forests are important
sources of resources, as are squares containing special resources symbols
for game, horses, coal, and oil.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of trade in generating taxes and technology makes
River squares especially good sites for cities when just beginning.
Without Rivers, you must quickly build roads to generate trade.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Landscaping:</b> When surveying sites for a new city, keep in mind the
potential for some squares to be improved. Hills and Mountains can be
mined and then produce increased resources. Plains, Rivers, and
Grasslands can be irrigated and then produce more food. Swamps and
Jungles can be cleared into Grasslands or converted to Forests. Forests
may be cleared into Plains. Plains and Grasslands may be turned into
Forests if you need resources. An area of Jungles and Swamps looks barren
at first, but has the potential to be a very rich city site.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plains, Grasslands, and Deserts produce trade once penetrated by
Roads, and all land squares improve in production when Railroads arrive.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Proximity of Cities:</b> Another consideration when planning new cities
is the current or potential location of other cities. Minimize the
economic radius overlap of your cities as much as possible. Since a map
area may only be used by one city, too much overlap restricts the
potential growth of one or both cities. When just beginning, explore
nearby lands as soon as possible to begin planning the placement of
future cities to best take advantage of the terrain. A few large and
powerful cities are more useful than several smaller, weaker ones.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Strategic Value:</b> The strategic value of a city's site is a final
consideration. Because the underlying terrain can increase the defender's
strength when under attack, in some circumstances the defensive value of
terrain may be more important than economic value. But good defensive
terrain is generally poor for food production and inhibits the early
growth of a city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, defending a city is generally easier than defending normal
terrain. In a city you can build the City Walls improvement which triples
the strength of defenders. Also, in cities only one army at a time is
destroyed in combat. Outside of cities, all armies stacked together are
destroyed when any army in the stack is defeated. So, in certain cases
where a continent bottlenecks and a rival is on the other side, the
defensive value of a city site may be more critical than economic value.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing at least a few cities on the coast gives you access to the
ocean. This allows the launching of ship units to explore the world and
transport your units overseas. With a few coastal cities, your seapower
is constrained.

</font></td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">City Management</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several goals for management of a city: keeping it stable
(avoiding civil disorder), keeping its population growing, maximizing a
useful mix of economic development (food, resources, and trade),
producing tax revenue, producing technology research, and producing
useful units and improvements.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stability:</b> Cities that don't maintain a favorable balance of happy
people over unhappy people go into civil disorder (see below). Cities in
civil disorder produce no tax revenue, no technology research, and no
food surpluses, and suspend production. A nuclear reactor in a city
suffering civil disorder may experience a meltdown due to lax safety
controls (see Nuclear Meltdown).
Keeping a city stable is a very high priority.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Population Growth:</b> Keeping the population growing is important
because each additional person contributes something to your
civilization. Each new worker brings a map square under production.
Population growth increases economic power, and thus, the strength of
your civilization. The size of your population is a major factor in
determining your civilization score, a measure of how well you have
ruled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Resource Development:</b> The people of your city that work in the
surrounding countryside harness the economic resources of the area. Those
resources are converted by the city into more people, industrial
production, money, and technology research. When managing a city, you
must allocate the people so as to maximize this development, or match it
up to your needs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be times when increased industrial output is preferred
over population growth. There may be times when increased trade is
needed.
You can give orders to your advisors to shift a city's work force around
to change the mix of economic development as desired.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tax Revenue:</b> Most of the improvements that can be built within
cities require money for maintenance. Money is also useful for speeding
industrial production, bribing enemy armies, inciting revolts in enemy
cities, and for negotiating peace with your neighbors. The combined tax
revenues of your cities must exceed their maintenance requirements before
cash can accumulate for other uses.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not necessary for each city to produce surplus
revenue, enough cities must do so to cover expenses. Some cities may not
be especially suited for industrial production, but may still be good
trading centers. Manage these cities to produce extra revenue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Technology Research:</b> The greater the contribution of research each
city makes toward new technology, the faster the new civilization advance
is reached. The amount of research done in each city is a function of the
science rate. This is a percentage of the city's trade devoted to
bringing in new ideas and otherwise discovering technology advances. A
city's research contribution can also be influenced by adjusting trade,
creating Scientists, and certain improvements. Improvements that can help
are the Library and University, which improve research, and several
Wonders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Industrial Production:</b> Each city has more or less capacity to
produce
new units and improvements. The most valuable cities have the greatest
industrial capacity. They can quickly produce expensive military units
that extend the power of your civilization. They are also the best at
producing the Wonders of the World. You must regularly monitor the
production of your cities to insure that most needed items are being
built.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four main tools available to reach and maintain these
goals of city management: shifting workers around, converting some
workers to Specialists, building improvements, and building Wonders of
the World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers can be shifted around the city map display to adjust
economic development. Specialists can be created to increase the
production of luxuries, taxes, or technology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within each city you can order the construction of improvements such
as a Temple to make some unhappy people content, a Granary to speed
population growth, or a Library to increase historic research. From
either source you can also learn the construction and maintenance cost of
each improvement, its purpose, and what technology is required to make it
available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most costly tools available are the Wonders of the World. These
are magnificent improvements that bring lasting glory to your
civilization in addition to some special effect. Possible Wonders are
described in the manual section Wonders of the World, or in the
Civilopedia. Although Wonders are built in a city like an improvement,
their special effect often extends through all or part of your
civilization. However, only one of each Wonder may be built in the world
and your rivals may construct them first.

captured by rivals or barbarians. Part of the management plan must
concern the city's defense. A large part of the defense is not handled
locally, but on your borders and coasts. A defensive line of units, both
at sea and on land, that can intercept enemies before they close with
your cities can be helpful.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the best defensive lines can be penetrated, so the defense of
the city itself cannot be neglected. The minimum city defense is one
army,
preferably with a good defensive factor. Fortify any armies that you
expect to defend a city (by press the F key on the IBM) because Fortified
units increase their defensive strength. A second defender is often a
good idea. Adding an army with a strong attack factor is also useful.
This army can attack enemies that move adjacent to the city, perhaps
destroying them before they test the defenders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defense of the city can be substantially improved by building
City Walls, an improvement that triples the defender's strength versus
most attackers, but not Bombers or Artillery. This tripling takes place
after the effects of veteran status is considered. Being fortified
behind City Walls has no effect unless the attacking unit is a Bomber or
Artillery unit. City Walls also prevent population loss when defending
units are destroyed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When civilization advances make available new army types with better
defense factors, take the first opportunity to replace old defenders with
better units. Since the offensive capability of your enemies improves as
they acquire new technology, your defenses must improve to keep up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linking cities with Roads and Railroads can be very helpful in
speeding the movement of units from one end of your empire to trouble
spots elsewhere. This puts your defensive armies on "interior lines,"
allowing them to rapidly move to where they are needed.

people (content people are ignored in the calculation). Cities in
disorder provide no tax revenue, contribute no technology research, and
suspend production of new units or improvements. When order is restored,
the city returns to normal operation next turn. You can restore order
several ways.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To restore order you may pay to complete an improvement, such as a
Temple, that can convert sufficient unhappy people to contentment (or
content people to happiness) to restore balance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also change the luxury and tax rates to attempt to restore
order. Increasing luxuries may make some content people happy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may take one or more people out of the work force, making them
Specialists. This increases the number of happy people. When creating
Specialists, be careful not to cause shortages of food or resources that
cause starvation of population or scrapping of armies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the government types Despotism, Monarchy, or Communism, it is
possible to restore order to a city using martial law. Each military unit
in a city makes one unhappy citizen content. Only those units possessing
an attack factor of 1 or more can impose martial law. By moving enough
units into a city suffering civil disorder, order may be restored.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Republican or Democratic government, each military unit not in
its home city creates one or more unhappy citizen. When a city is in
disorder, destroying distant military units, returning them to the home
city, or changing their home city, makes some unhappy people content and
may restore the city to order.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these methods are useful in restoring the balance of your
cities or enemy cities that you have just captured.

honor of your rule. The people declare a "We Love the (King) Day" in
thanks for the prosperity you have made possible. While the circumstances
that trigger this celebratory mood continue, the city enjoys certain
benefits, depending on your civilization's type of government.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for the "We Love the (King) Day" celebration to occur,
there must be no unhappy people in the city, at least as many happy
people as content people, and the city must have a population of at least
three. Specialists are considered content citizens for this calculation.
For example, a city with five happy people, four content people, and no
unhappy people celebrates. A city with ten happy people, three content
people, and one unhappy people, does not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Anarchy:</b> The celebration has no effect when the government is in
Anarchy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Despotism:</b> The celebrating city is operated as if the government is
a Monarchy. This can increase the amount of food and resources generated
when some terrains are irrigated and mined.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Monarchy/Communism:</b> A celebrating city currently ruled by either of
these governments is operated as if the government is a Democracy
instead. This increases the amount of trade generated.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Republic/Democracy:</b> A celebrating city currently ruled by either of
these governments increases in population by one point each turn so long
as sufficient food is available. This can result in dramatic growth of
the city.</font></td></tr>

you assign the population to work in the surrounding fields, mines,
forests, and fishing grounds. Here also you determine what unit or other
item the city is to produce. The display provides in one place critical
information concerning the city's status: how much food, resources, and
trade it is generating; what it is producing and how close the item is to
completion; the happiness of the population; what is defending the city;
and what improvements have been built.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This display is opened from the map window. (On the IBM, click the
LMB on the city's map square.) The city display is closed with the exit
button. (On the IBM, click the LMB on the exit button.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city display consists of the following parts: city map, city
resources window, population roster, food storage box, production box,
improvement roster, information window, and the home city window. Each
part performs a specific function or reports information. 

</font></td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">City Map</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the map squares surrounding the city that may be
developed by the city's population. The maximum number of squares that a
city may put into development equals the number of people plus one, but
the additional one is always the city square itself. Note that it is
possible to have more population than places to put them to work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the type of terrain in a map square, putting people to
work there may generate food (the grain symbol), resources (the shield
symbol) or trade (the arrows symbol). Most squares produce a combination
of several items. You may move people from one square to another as you
wish to change the mix of food, resources, and trade the city generates.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People removed from the city map are temporarily converted into
Specialists (see below) in the population roster. When they are put back
to work on the map, they convert back to normal people. (To remove people
on the IBM, place the mouse pointer on the correct map square and click
the LMB. To put them back to work, place the pointer on the city map
square where you wish them to go and click the LMB again.) As people are
removed, replaced, and switched around, the resources generated by the
city also change.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the city population increases, the new people are automatically
assigned an area to develop. You may wish to review the map of a city
that has just increased in size to be sure the workers are placed as you
wish.

luxuries, taxes, and scientific research generated by the city's people.
These commodities are the raw materials of your civilization. They are
brought into the city and there become new people, new units, city
improvements, Wonders of the World, cash, and civilization advances.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food, resources, and trade are collected each turn from the city map
squares. In some cases the amount of a commodity collected may be
increased by the presence of a certain improvement in the city, or
ownership of a certain Wonder. For example, a Factory improvement
increases resource production by 50%. A city that produces 10 resources
from its city map actually has 15 resources to spend if it has a Factory.
Trade is further divided into the three commodities that trade brings in:
luxuries, cash, and science (knowledge). The division of trade depends on
the trade rates shown in the status report of the map display. Under
certain conditions, some trade is lost as corruption.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Food:</b> A population point in your city requires two units of food
each turn. If your city is currently producing more food than that, the
surplus is shown after a break in the food line. The excess goes into the
food storage box shown elsewhere on the city display and described below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not producing enough food to feed the population, the
amount of food you are short is shown as shortfall in the food line (on
the IBM, this is shown by black food symbols). Each turn this shortage
cannot be made up from food in storage the city's population decreases by
one.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing Settler units that a city has produced also require one or
two food units per turn, depending on your type of government.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Resources:</b> The shield symbols indicate the resources of raw
materials and industrial capacity of the city. Depending on the form of
government of your civilization, part of your capacity may be required to
maintain units that the city has built. Surplus capacity is shown to the
right of a break in the industry line and is available to be used to
build new units or city improvements. This surplus goes into the
production box shown elsewhere on the display and described below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the city's industrial capacity is not sufficient to maintain
existing units for which this is the home city, the amount of resources
that you are short is shown in the resource line as a shortfall (on the
IBM, the symbols are black). If the resources available are not
sufficient to maintain all existing units, then units not maintained are
destroyed wherever they exist, beginning with the one farthest from the
city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diplomats and Caravans do not require maintenance under any form of
government.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic amount of resources generated may be increased by
improving the city with a Factory, Manufacturing Plant, Power Plant,
Nuclear Plant, or Hydro Plant. The Hoover Dam Wonder improves the
resources for all cities on its continent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Trade:</b> Trade is produced by Roads through Plains, Deserts and
Grasslands, by Rivers, by Oceans/Lakes, by squares containing Gold Mines
or Gems, and by Caravan trade routes. trade arrives as luxuries, taxes,
and scientific research, depending on your trade rates. For example, if
your luxury/tax/science rates shown on the map display are 3.3.4, 30% of
your trade arrives as luxuries, 30% as tax revenue, and 40% as science.
At these rates, a city generating ten trade would convert that into three
diamonds of luxuries, three coins of taxes, and four light bulbs of
research.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade may be increased by trade routes established by Caravans, by
certain types of government, by the Colossus Wonder, and when a city
celebrates "We Love the (King) Day".
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Luxuries:</b> These are shown as diamonds. For every two diamonds of
luxuries produced, one content citizen becomes happy. Luxuries are most
useful for making people happy, especially in very large cities that may
have a large segment of unhappy people that need to be countered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of luxuries generated may be increased quickly by
creating Entertainers, a type of Specialist discussed below. Luxuries may
be increased by raising the luxury rate of trade brought in. Luxuries are
best increased by increasing the amount of trade the city generates. The
amount of luxuries brought in by trade may be increased by a Marketplace
or Bank.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tax Revenues:</b> These are shown as gold coins and are used to pay
maintenance costs for city improvements. Surplus taxes collected are
added to the treasury and can be spent later. The amount of taxes
collected from trade may be increased by Taxmen, another type of
Specialist. The amount of taxes brought in by trade may be increased by a
Marketplace or Bank.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Science:</b> The knowledge that results from science research is shown
as light bulbs. Each new technology that you direct your scientists to
discover requires a certain amount of research. When enough lightbulbs of
research have been spent, the new advance is acquired by your
civilization. The Library and University improvements plus some of the
Wonders of the World increase the amount of research a city does. In
addition, research may be increased by another type of specialist,
Scientists.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Corruption:</b> Depending on your type of government and the city's
distance from your palace, some trade may be lost as corruption.
Corruption is marked by a modified trade symbol after a break in the
trade line. (On the IBM, the trade symbol has a dark shadow.) The farther
your city from the city containing your Palace (your capital) the more
corruption and lost trade. Building a Courthouse improvement in the city
reduces corruption.

population roster. Each person represents one population point. In
addition to normal workers, the city may include three different types of
specialist, discussed below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal people who work in city map areas are shown as either
happy, content, or unhappy. You must manage your city's production and
improvements so that at least a balance of happy and unhappy people is
maintained. If the number of unhappy people exceeds the number of happy
people (with content people being ignored in this case) your city goes
into civil disorder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the population roster is a quick way to see how the
balance of happy and unhappy citizens stands. When a city is about to
increase in size, it may be useful to adjust the work force so that the
city is not thrown in to disorder by the increase. You can examine the
population rosters of all of your cities at one time by consulting your
Attitude Advisor from the Advisor menu.

</font></td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><hr width="100%" size="1" noshade="noshade"><div align="right"><font size="3">Specialists</font></div></td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People taken off the work force and removed from the city map become
specialists. These people no longer directly contribute to the food,
resources, and trade the city generates. However, they may be useful in
adjusting the amount of luxuries, taxes, and science the city generates.
If your city is producing sufficient food, you may be able to afford
Specialists and their special abilities. Specialists require food like
other people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three types of Specialists. Entertainers are musicians and
other artists who provide luxuries for your city and their presence makes
more people happy. Taxmen are bureaucrats who make the city government,
specifically tax collection, more efficient. Scientists are researchers
who increase the city's contribution toward discovering new technology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Entertainers:</b> People removed from the work force immediately become
Entertainers. Each Entertainer is the equivalent of two additional trade
symbols added to that part of the city's trade brought in as luxuries.
This additional trade is added before the effects of improvements such as
Marketplaces and Banks are calculated. Creating Entertainers has the
result of creating more luxuries and making more happy people.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Taxmen:</b> You can change an Entertainer into a Taxman. (On the IBM,
click the LMB on the Entertainer in the population roster. The
Entertainer converts into a Taxman.) Each Taxman has a similar effect to
that of an Entertainer, except that tax revenues are increased, not
luxuries. When an Entertainer is converted, the luxury benefit stops
working.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that increasing taxes is only helpful if the city remains out
of civil disorder. Otherwise, no collection is made.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Scientists:</b> You can change a Taxman into a Scientist. (On the IBM,
click the LMB on a Taxman and he is converted to a Scientist.) This
Specialist is a researcher who increases the amount of knowledge your
city is producing, just as Entertainers increase luxuries and Taxmen
increase taxes. As with Taxmen, Scientists are only useful if your city
is not in civil disorder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can convert Taxmen back into Entertainers.

turn. This is food needed to feed the city's population and the Settlers
that it is supporting. Food put in the storage box is stored and
accumulates each turn. When the box overflows, your city's population
grows by one point and a new citizen is added to the population roster.
The storage box is emptied and begins to fill again next turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one of your cities is not currently producing enough food to feed
its population, the people don't starve so long as food is available for
use in its storage box. Each turn, any food shortage is subtracted from
food in the box. If the box is empty and the city still has a food
shortfall, one point of population starves and disappears.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Granary improvement has the effect of speeding population
growth. When a city has a Granary, the storage box only half empties when
it overflows and creates more people. The box empties only to the granary
line. In addition, a Granary protects the city from starvation during a
Famine disaster.

turn. Surplus resources are those not needed to maintain existing units
and are shown to the right of the break in the resource line in the city
resources window. Resources accumulate in the box until it fills, thereby
completing the unit or improvement being built.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item being built is noted by its icon, if it is a unit, or its
name if it is an improvement or Wonder. The items available for building
depend on the technology your civilization has achieved at the moment.
The size of the production box grow or shrinks, depending on the number
of resources required to build each item. You may change the item being
built during any turn before it is completed. You may also speed the
completion of an item by paying for a rush job.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Change production:</b> Use the Change button to open the menu of items
that you can produce. (On the IBM, click the LMB on the button.) Then
make your selection from the menu of choices that appears. The production
box changes size to indicate the resource cost of your selection and the
name or the icon of the new item appears at the top of the box.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are producing an item that is no longer available from the
menu, that production continues even after the item is completed.
However, if you open the production menu while producing an obsolete
item, you must make a new choice as the old one disappears.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are building a Wonder and another civilization completes it
before you can, you must change the production of your city. You are
taken to your city's display in order to make the production change.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rush Jobs:</b> You may rush completion of a partially built item by
paying to complete it immediately. To rush completion, use the Buy button
at the top right of the box. (On the IBM, click the LMB on the button.) A
menu appears showing how much money is required to finish the object by
the end of the turn. Choose whether to rush the item or not. To speed the
completion of an item in this manner costs at least $2 per missing
resource. If no resources have gone into an item, i.e., the production
box is empty, the cost of a rush job is doubled.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items completed by rush jobs are available at the beginning of your
next turn, so there is no advantage for rushing items that would complete
next turn anyway. To judge whether an item can be completed next turn
without rushing, compare the surplus resources the city is generating to
the number needed to finish. For very expensive items, it may be useful
to consult your city status advisor for an exact count of the remaining
cost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sabotage:</b> Enemy Diplomats may slip into your cities and destroy
items partially completed. All resources currently invested in an item
are destroyed and production starts over. Your only protection from this
is to destroy enemy Diplomats before they can enter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disaster:</b> Pirate raids also destroy the partially completed item in
the production box. The only defense against them is the Barracks
improvement.

of the city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the top of the window are several buttons: Info, Happy, View,
Map. Using these buttons you can call up the information you wish to see.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Map:</b> Pressing this button calls up a small version of the world map.
The city you are in is marked for reference. (On the IBM, the city is a
white dot.) Also marked on the map are the location of any cities with
which you have established trade routes (shown as light green dots) and
the location of units that make this their home city (light grey dots).
The map may be useful for planning additional trade routes, assessing the
danger of enemies, locating units you wish to disband, or deciding a
sailing direction for newly launched ships.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>View:</b> This button opens the bird's-eye view of the city that is seen
when a new improvement or Wonder of the World is built. As time passes,
note that the architecture of the various dwellings improves.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Info:</b> This button calls up the most useful information. When you
first open any city display, this button is automatically on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just below the row of buttons are the icons for all units currently
in the city. Fortified units have a border around them and units on
sentry duty are shown as faded icons. Fortified units or those on sentry
duty may only be activated from this window. (On the IBM, click the LMB
on the unit.) When you return to the map display, these units can now be
given orders.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the window is a list of any trade routes the city
has established. Each trade route is noted by the name of the city with
which you are trading and the amount of trade generated. This trade is
automatically included in the trade your city is generating, shown in the
city resources window of the display.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As your civilization moves into the Industrial Age, pollution may
become a problem. In the middle of this window, pollution indicators
(smokestack icons) appear when the city's industry gets sufficiently
large.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of several smokestacks is a cue that you need to reduce
pollution or be prepared to clean it up. The alternative is eventual
environmental disaster. There can be up to one hundred smokestacks
present, indicating a 100% probability of pollution each turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Happy:</b> This button opens the Population Happiness Chart, which shows
what factors are affecting the happiness of the city's population. All
people in a city beyond a certain number are unhappy before any modifying
influences are taken into account. At the Emperor level of difficulty,
only the first two people are content; at King level, the first three;
and so on down to Chieftan level, where the first six people are content.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the city's population increases beyond these minimums, the new
people are unhappy unless their condition is improved by a culture and
standard of living that provides luxuries, religion, and entertainment;
they are coerced into contentment by martial law; or the presence of
Wonders of the World lifts their pride and spirits.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top row of the chart shows the happiness of the population
before taking into account any of the factors that improve happiness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second row shows the effects of the luxuries that are provided
to the city, if any. Two units of luxuries make one content person happy
or one unhappy person content. A contented person is made happy before
another unhappy person is made content.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third row shows the effect of Temples, Cathedrals, and
Colosseums. These improvements make unhappy people content.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth row shows the effects of martial law and military
service. Under all governments except the Republic and Democracy, each
military unit in a city coerces one unhappy person into contentment. Any
units imposing marital law are shown in this row. Under the Republic or
Democracy, martial law does not work. Instead, each military unit not in
its home city makes one or more persons unhappy. This is shown by the
"sad face" symbols in this row and under the units in the home city
roster.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth row shows the effects of any Wonders of the World, either
in this city or elsewhere, that are influencing the population's
happiness. For example, J.S. Bach's Cathedral decreases the number of
unhappy people by two.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists are content people, and are taken from the ranks of the
content or happy population when created. The effect of the increased
luxuries created by Entertainers is shown in row two.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom row or the chart shows the cumulative effect of all the
factors on the happiness of the population. The status shown in this row
is the same as that in the population roster at the top of the display.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examining this chart is useful for understanding what else could be
done if the city is out of balance. You may see where creating
Entertainers, disbanding out of towns units, bringing in more units, or
building a new improvement can bring the city back into order.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td width="5%" valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td width="95%" valign="top"><font size="1"><font size="3"><b><a name="4c"></a>CITY IMPROVEMENTS</b></font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City improvements are the commercial, bureaucratic, educational, and
public works infrastructure that make large and efficient cities
possible. The potential size of a city is limited by inadequate provision
of these facilities. The dense population of New York is made possible by
the subway system. Los Angeles is located in a desert and brings much of
its water from sources hundreds of miles away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Civilization</i>, improvements are also critical to the growth and
importance of cities. Each of the improvements available provides some
service or otherwise makes the city work more efficiently.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When beginning a new civilization, you normally may only build one
type of improvement, the Barracks. As your civilization acquires new
technologies, more improvements become possible. Each city may only build
one of each improvement. The improvements that your city possesses are
listed in the improvements roster on the city display. Once built,
improvements (but not Wonders) may be destroyed by sabotage, disaster,
and capture, and may even be sold for cash.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sabotage:</b> Diplomats may enter a city and attempt industrial
sabotage. This may result in the destruction of an existing improvement.
The only defense against this type of attack is destroying the Diplomat
before it can enter the city.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disaster:</b> Volcanos, Pirate Raids, Floods, Fires, and Earthquakes may
destroy improvements in a city. There is no defense against Earthquakes,
but Aqueducts prevent Fires, Temples prevent Volcanos, City Walls prevent
Floods, and Barracks prevent Pirate Raids.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Capture:</b> Some, all, or none of a city's improvements may be
destroyed when it is captured by another civilization. When a city is
completely destroyed, all improvements are destroyed as well.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Selling Improvements:</b> You may sell an existing improvement to raise
cash by pressing the sell button next to its name in the improvements
roster of the city display. (For the IBM, click the LMB on the button.)
An option menu appears showing how much cash you would receive for
selling, which is $1 per resource invested. Choose whether to sell or
not. If you sell, the improvement disappears from the city and the money
is added to your treasury.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling improvements may be useful when you are short of money and
threatened with the random sale of an improvement. It may also be useful
when you are under attack with no reasonable chance of defending or
recovering a city. By selling off its improvements, you reduce its value
to the enemy and salvage something. You may sell one improvement per
turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alphabetical list of improvements follows, including the benefit
of the improvement and the technology that makes it possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Aqueduct:</b><i> Cities without an Aqueduct may not grow beyond a size of
10 population points. In addition, Aqueducts prevent the disasters of
Fire and Plague.</i> Aqueducts require the advance of Construction, cost 120
resources to build, and cost $2 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Banks:</b><i> Banks increase the luxuries and taxes generated by a city by
50%.</i> They require the advance of Banking and the city must already have a
Marketplace improvement. The bonus from a Bank is added to that of an
existing Marketplace and then applied. This bonus takes effect after all
other considerations, including trade routes. Banks cost 120 resources to
build and #3 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Barracks:</b><i> New units built in this city are already veterans,
increasing their attack and defense factors by 50%. Barracks prevent the
disaster of pirates.</i> No technology is required to build Barracks.
However, all existing Barracks become obsolete and disappear when you
acquire the advances of Gunpowder and Combustion. Second generation
Barracks cost $1 per turn to maintain and third generation Barracks cost
$2 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cathedral:</b><i> A Cathedral makes four unhappy people content and is very
useful for keeping a large city out of civil disorder.</i> It requires the
advance of Religion, costs 160 resources to build, and costs $3 per turn
to maintain. The effect of all Cathedrals in your cities is increased if
you possess Michelangelo's Chapel, a medieval Wonder of the World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>City Walls:</b><i> City Walls triple the strength of a defending unit,
except when attack by a Bomber or Artillery unit. This tripling occurs
after considering the effect of terrain and veteran status. Cities
defended by City Walls do not suffer population losses when a defending
unit is destroyed. Walls also prevent the disaster of Flood.</i> They require
the advance of Masonry, cost 120 resources to build, and cost $2 per turn
to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Colosseum:</b> The Colosseum is a large stadium for holding athletic
contests and other events drawing crowds. <i>Its presence makes 3 unhappy
people content.</i> It requires the advance of Construction, costs 100
resources to build and costs $4 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Courthouse:</b><i> This improvement reduces corruption in a city by 50%.</i> It
requires the advance of the Code of Laws, costs 80 resources to build,
and costs$1 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Factory:</b><i> A Factory increases the amount of resources generated by a
city by 50%.</i> A Factory becomes obsolete and stops working if a
Manufacturing Plant is built in the same city. A Factory requires the
advance of Industrialization, costs 200 resources to build, and costs $4
per turn to maintain. The effect of a Factory may be increased by the
presence of a Hydro Plant, a Nuclear Plant, or a Power Plant. It may also
be increased by the Hoover Dam, a modern Wonder of the World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Granary:</b><i> Cities possessing a Granary use up only 50% of their stored
food to create new population. The storage box only half empties. In
addition, the Granary prevents a Famine disaster from destroying
population.</i> The Granary requires the advance of Pottery, costs 60
resources to build, and costs $1 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hydro Plant:</b><i> The production bonus for a Factory or Manufacturing
Plant is doubled if the city has a Hydro Plant. In addition, a Hydro
Plant reduces the probability of pollution.</i> A Hydro Plant may only be
built by a city adjacent to a River or Mountains. It requires the advance
of Electronics, costs 240 resources to build, and costs $4 per turn to
maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Power Plant Clarifications:</b> All three types of power plant increase
the base resource production of a city by 50%, before the effects of a
Factory or Manufacturing Plant are considered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Library:</b><i> A Library increases the knowledge production of a city by
50%. </i>It requires the advance of Writing, costs 80 resources to build, and
costs $1 to maintain. The effect of all Libraries in your cities is
increased if you possess Isaac Newton's College, a medieval Wonder of the
World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Manufacturing Plant:</b><i> This improvement increases the resources
generated by a city by 100%.</i> It requires the advance of Robotics, costs
320 resources to build, and costs $6 to maintain. Its presence makes an
already existing Factory obsolete and the Factory ceases to work. The
effect of a Manufacturing Plant may be increased by the presence of the
Hydro Plant, the Nuclear Plant, the Power Plant, or the Hoover Dam.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marketplace:</b><i> A marketplace increases tax revenue and luxuries by
50%.</i> The Marketplace becomes available with the advance of Currency,
costs 80 resources to build, and costs $1 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mass Transit:</b><i> In cities with Mass Transit, the population has no
effect on pollution.</i> Otherwise, when a civilization has acquired the
Automobile advance, the population of its cities increases the
probability of pollution. Mass Transit requires the advance of Mass
Production, costs 160 resources to build, and costs $4 to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nuclear Plant:</b> Like other types of power plants, <i>the Nuclear Plant
increases the production of a Factory or Manufacturing Plant by another
50%. A Nuclear Plant also reduces the day-to-day probability of
pollution.</i> However, a Nuclear Plant in a city suffering civil disorder
risks a Nuclear Meltdown. The
Nuclear Plant requires the advance of Nuclear Power, costs 160 resources
to build, and costs $2 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Palace:</b> This is the administrative and governmental center of your
civilization. <i>The farther any city is from the city containing the
Palace, the more corruption is likely.</i> You may build a new Palace in
another city, but this causes the retirement of the first Palace and
relocation of the government. If your Palace is destroyed, a new one may
be built in any existing city. The Palace requires the advance of Masonry
and costs 200 resources to build. Your Palace costs nothing to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Power Plant:</b><i> This source of industrial power increases the resources
generated by Factories and Manufacturing Plants by an additional 50%.</i>
However, it increases the probability fo pollution significantly. The
Power Plant requires the advance of Refining, costs 160 resources to
build, and costs $2 per turn to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Recycling Center:</b><i> The recycling center reduces the probability of
pollution by two-thirds.</i> It requires the advance of Recycling, costs 200
resources to build, and costs $2 to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>SDI Defense:</b><i> The SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) Defense protects
the city from Nuclear units. Attacks by these weapons have no effect.</i>
This improvement becomes available with the Superconductor advance. The
SDI defense costs 200 resources to build and costs $4 to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Temple:</b> The Temple improvement becomes available with the Ceremonial
Burial advance. <i>Its presence makes one person content. With the
additional advance of Mysticism, another person is made content by a
Temple, for a total of two. A Temple prevents the Volcano disaster.</i>
Temples cost 40 resources to build and $1 to maintain. The effect of a
Temple may be doubled if you possess the Oracle, an ancient Wonder of the
World.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>University:</b><i> The presence of a University increases the knowledge
generated by a city by 50%.</i> A University may only be built in a city that
already possesses a Library. The University bonus is added to the bonus
from an existing Library. Together they double the knowledge generated.
Universities become available with the advance of University. They
cost 160 resources to build and $3 to maintain. The effect of all
Universities in your cities is increased if you possess the Isaac
Newton's College, a medieval Wonder of the World.</font></td></tr>

make possible the building of Wonders of the World. There are 21 Wonders,
7 each for the three great epochs of civilization: Antiquity, the Middle
Ages, (including the Renaissance), and the Industrial Age (present and
future). These Wonders are the extraordinary monuments of a civilization,
bringing everlasting glory and other benefits to their owners.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Wonder is a dramatic, awe-inspiring accomplishment. It is
typically a great achievement of engineering, science, or the arts,
representing a milepost in the history of humankind. Each Wonder is
unique, existing only in the city where it is constructed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the glory attached to owning a Wonder, each one has a
specific, unique benefit. The people of your civilization are able to
perform amazing feats, inspired by their pride in the possession of
Wonders. For example, if your civilization possesses the Lighthouse, your
ship units are able to move one additional map square per turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of some Wonders apply only to the civilization that
possesses them. If a Wonder you build is lost when one of your cities is
captured, the powers of the Wonder then apply to the conquering
civilization. The same holds true if you capture a Wonder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the benefits of the ancient Wonders and most of the Wonders
of the Middle Ages may not stand for all time. Objects and
accomplishments that awed the ancients may not similarly inspire the
people of the Industrial Age. The achievement of later advances may end
the benefits of later Wonders, regardless of whether your civilization or
another makes the cancelling advance.

technology. For example, when your civilization acquires Map Making, you
may begin construction of the Lighthouse.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may only build a Wonder if it does not already exist somewhere
else in the world. If it exists in another city, it does not appear as an
option in your production menus. If you are building a Wonder in one of
your cities and the same Wonder is completed elsewhere before you finish,
you cannot complete your construction. You must convert your production
to something else.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder are not destroyed when an enemy occupies their city. However,
if a city possessing a Wonder is destroyed, then that Wonder is
lost forever and cannot be rebuilt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonders are built in the same manner as any other city improvement
with one exception. You may move a Caravan into the city of construction
and accept the option "help build Wonder." All the resources that went
into the Caravan are added to the construction of the Wonder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonders may be built in any city and more than one may be built in
the same city.

An example of a
specific benefit is increased movement of your ships when you possess the
Lighthouse.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General benefits are the glory that accrues to your civilization for
possessing the Wonder, even after new technology makes it obsolete. Each
Wonder that your civilization possesses adds to your civilization score.
The presence of Wonders are significant when the top 5 cities in the
world are measured. The presence of Wonders also influences the
historians, such as Gibbon, who periodically rate the world's
civilizations. Finally, Wonders also influence the decision of the people
to improve your palace.

or harbor mouth of the city. This amazing statue draws tourists from
around the world, greatly increasing the trade of the area.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Trade is +1 in every city map square that is already generating some
trade.</i> The effect on tourism stop working after development of
Electricity and the trade is thereafter lost. The Colossus requires the
advance of Bronze Working and takes 200 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Great Library:</b> Begun as a hobby by a local ruler, the Great Library
is an obsession for the city. Its agents scour the world for books and
manuscripts, making the Great Library the largest repository in
existence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Great Library gives you any technology that two other
civilizations have acquired.</i> However, it stops working after development
of the University. It requires the advance of Literacy and takes 300
resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Great Wall:</b> The Great Wall was built not so much to keep invaders
out, but to retard their escape with any loot. The effect is to deter the
aggressiveness of neighbors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>When you possess the Great Wall, other civilizations always offer
peace during negotiations.</i> However, the effect of the Great Wall ceases
after development of Gunpowder. It requires the Masonry advance and takes
300 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hanging Gardens:</b> The magnificent Hanging Gardens are a great
marriage of engineering and beauty. Architecturally brilliant layered
tiers of gardens are ingeniously supplied with water. Any visitor is
overwhelmed by the grace of this man-made garden of paradise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Possessing this beautiful monument brings great pleasure to the
people of your civilization and results in +1 happy citizen in each of
your cities.</i> This magical effect of the Hanging Gardens expires with the
development of Invention because, thereafter, the gadgetry of the garden
design becomes cheaply available to everyone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge of the Hanging Gardens is acquired with the advance of
Pottery, and the Wonder takes 300 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lighthouse:</b> The construction of this immense Lighthouse not only
creates the greatest navigational aid of antiquity, but triggers a birth
of seafaring skills and traditions. The result is great achievements by
your ships and captains.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Possession of the Lighthouse increases sea movement rates by 1
square for all of your ships.</i> However, the effect of the Lighthouse
ceases working after development of Magnetism, a new navigational aid
that puts competent sailing within the grasp of anyone. The Lighthouse
requires the advance of MapMaking and it takes 200 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Oracle:</b> Building the Oracle gives the beliefs of your civilization a
unifying central dogma that increases its effect on the people. The
auguries of the Oracle are transmitted through the local Temples,
exerting significant control over their lives.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Oracle becomes available with the advance of Mysticism and
doubles the effect of your Temples in making unhappy people content.</i> It
stops working after the development of Religion, which appeals more
widely to the growing literate, intelligent citizenry. The Oracle takes
300 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Pyramids:</b> The Pyramids are the greatest and oldest of the ancient
Wonders. Their construction requires great government control of the
entire nation to make possible the effort of their construction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A civilization that possesses the Pyramids may change government
type without going through a period of Anarchy. In addition, that
civilization may select any type of government, not just those for which
it has made the correct advance.</i> For example, the possessing nation may
become a Democracy long before it acquires the technology of Democracy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pyramids require the advancement of Masonry and take 300
resources to build. However, the effects of the Pyramids expire after the
advance of Communism is achieved.

of his cathedral, this Polish priest re-established that the Sun was the
center of the Solar System, not Earth. This fact had been recognized by
ancient astronomers but lost in the Dark Ages, buried under superstition
and religious dogma. Copernicus's findings were controversial but proven
true, and were an important step in the rebirth of Western science.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Building Copernicus's Observatory doubles knowledge production in
the city, after all adjustments for Libraries, Universities, and
Scientists.</i> However, this benefit stops working after development of the
Automobile. The advance of Astronomy makes the Observatory possible. It
costs 300 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Darwin's Voyage:</b> Partially from the research accomplished on his
scientific voyage aboard the <i>Beagle</i> to the Galapagos Islands, Charles
Darwin developed the theory of evolution that was published in his
masterwork, <i>The Origin of Species.</i> Darwin's arguments, and those of his
contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, were so convincing that they were
only disputed on philosophical grounds, mainly by religious
fundamentalists. The theory of organic evolution was the foundation of
all following research in biology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The civilization that builds Darwin's Voyage immediately acquires
two civilization advances.</i> The advance of Railroads makes Darwin's Voyage
possible. The Voyage costs 300 resources.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Isaac Newton's College:</b> Considered by many to be the greatest
scientist of all time, Newton developed theories of universal gravitation
that explained both the motion of heavenly bodies and the falling of
bodies to Earth. He also wrote important works on calculus, optics, the
spectrum of light, fluid mechanics, the motion of comets, and the motion
of tides, and built the first reflecting telescope. For 32 years he was a
professor of mathematics at Cambridge University.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Possessing Newton's College increases the knowledge benefit of all
your Libraries and Universities.</i> It may be built once you have acquired
the Theory of Gravity, but stops working after the development of Nuclear
Fission. The College requires 400 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>J.S. Bach's Cathedral:</b> Johann Sebastian Bach was one of the great
composers of the Western world. He was noted as a virtuoso performer
during his life, but has become much more revered since his passing for
the genius of his music. The majority of his compositions were written
while serving the church, and most pieces were written for the organ and
dedicated to the glory of his God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Possessing Bach's Cathedral decreases unhappy citizens on the same
continent by 2 per city.</i> The Cathedral may be built after the advance of
Religion and costs 400 resources. The power of Bach's music does not
expire.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Magellan's Expedition:</b> Ferdinand Magellan, a Portugese navigator,
led the first expedition that circumnavigated the globe. Sponsored by
Charles I of Spain, he was searching for a westward route to the spice
islands of the Moluccas. Along the way, he discovered the straits at Cape
Horn that bear his name. Unfortunately, he died in the Philippines
fighting natives. Only one of his five original ships and few of his men
reached home, but the expedition proved that the Earth was round.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Possessing Magellan's Expedition increases sea movement rates by 1
square for all of your ships.</i> The expedition becomes possible after the
advance of Navigation and never expires. It costs 400 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Michaelangelo's Chapel:</b> Michaelangelo Buonarroti was perhaps the
greatest of the Renaissance sculptors and painters. Working for the
church in Rome and the Medici family in Florence, he is best known for
his sculpture of David and the painting of the Sistine Chapel. He is
renowned for the beauty of his work and its influence on succeeding
generations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may build the Chapel after achieving the advance of Religion.
<i>Possessing it increases the benefits of Cathedrals throughout your
civilization until the advance of Communism diminishes the strength of
Religion.</i> The Chapel takes 300 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shakespeare's Theatre:</b> William Shakespeare, an English Dramatist and
poet, is considered the greatest of all playwrights. Little is known of
his life and he seems not to have become rich or famous in his own day.
But not long after his death his fame began to grow and his influence on
the English language has increased with the renown of his plays, which
are still performed regularly around the globe.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theatre may be built after achieving the advance of Medicine.
<i>Thereafter, all unhappy people in the city are content, until the advance
of Electronics makes the Theatre obsolete.</i> It costs 400 resources to
build.

Apollo Program put several manned expeditions onto the Moon. Quickly
overcoming many difficulties and dangers, the Apollo Program was one of
the greatest technological achievements of the age. Its success promises
that humankind may not be restricted just to Earth, but may eventually
expand into space.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apollo Program may be built after achieving the advance of Space
Flight. <i>It allows construction of space ships by any civilization having
th technology to build parts. An additional benefit of the Apollo Program
is the ability to see the location of all cities in the world.</i> The Apollo
Program costs 600 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cure for Cancer:</b> Of the diseases that continue to plague humankind,
cancer remains one of the most feared and deadly. Despite huge efforts to
find a cure for this malady, it continues to reap its toll each year. The
developing science of genetic engineering offers new hope for a cure.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the development of the advance of Genetic Engineering, you may
work on the Cure for Cancer. <i>Possessing the Cure creates +1 happy citizen
in all cities of your civilization.</i> The Cure for Cancer costs 600
resources.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hoover Dam:</b> Huge hydroelectric power sources were first developed in
the United States during the 1930s and have since been built throughout
the world. Converting the kinetic energy of falling water into electric
power has proven to be relatively cheap and environmentally sound method
of generating electricity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hoover Dam may be built after the advance of Electronics is
acquired. <i>The Dam provides electric power to all cities on the same
continent, increasing the resources generated by the city by 50%. In
addition, the Dam reduces the probability of pollution from these cities.</i>
The Hoover Dam costs 600 resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Manhattan Project:</b> The Manhattan Project was the codename for the
theoretical and practical development of atomic weapons. Once completed,
the world's future immediately was in doubt because the weapons it had
made possible threatened extinction of all life on Earth. But these
weapons also offered an umbrella of peace due to their destructiveness.
Massive global war became obsolete because the participants were doomed,
win or lose.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, surviving the Nuclear Age and environmental poisoning are the
two greatest challenges of industrial civilization.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Once any civilization completes the Manhattan Project, all
civilizations in the world may begin building Nuclear weapons, if they
have the proper technology.</i> The Manhattan project may be built once the
advance of Nuclear Fission has been achieved. The Project costs 600
resources to build.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>SETI Program:</b> The search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is a
research effort set up to find an answer for one of humankind's most
nagging questions: Are we the only intelligent life in the universe?
Being the first civilization to contact other intelligent life brings
great glory and perhaps technological advantages.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SETI Program may be built when your civilization acquires the
advance of Computers. <i>Thereafter, the knowledge generated by your cities
is increased by 50%, unless the Program is destroyed or captured by a
rival.</i> The SETI Program costs 600 resources to complete.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Women's Suffrage:</b> A phenomena of the cultural, philosophical, and
social changes that followed the Industrial Revolution has been a
steadily increasing respect for the rights and abilities of women. Women
demanded and won the franchise of the vote, first in the Western
Democracies, after demonstrating their ability to perform well almost any
job while the men were off to war. This symbolic freeing from historical
hierarchies has led to increasing practical freedom, at least in the
West.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's Suffrage becomes available after the advance of
Industrialization. <i>Under a Republic or Democracy, units away from their
home city create one less unhappy citizen than normal for a civilization
that possesses Women's Suffrage.</i> It costs 600 resources to achieve.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>United Nations:</b> The United Nations is an international organization
that meets to solve international problems through diplomacy. Its goal is
world peace and security. It offers a forum for debate and also works to
aid the economic and technical development of poorer nations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the United Nations is a great achievement by a
civilization. It is available after the advance of Communism. <i>During
negotiations with other civilizations, they always offer to make peace
with you.</i> This allows at least a temporary resolution to all wars you are
engaged in. The United Nations costs 600 resources to build.

strike one of your cities. A disaster may result in loss of population,
destruction of a city improvement, or disruption of production. Some
disasters may be prevented if your civilization has acquired certain
advances or if the city has built a certain improvement. In these cases,
the disaster does not occur or has not effect.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possible disasters are described below. For each there is an
explanation of why it occurs (if a reason exists), the effect on your
city when it strikes, and what measures can prevent it, if any.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Earthquake:</b> Earthquakes may strike any city that is built adjacent
to Hills terrain. There is nothing that you can build or learn to prevent
this disaster. An earthquake destroys one city improvement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Famine:</b> Famine strikes randomly. It can be prevented by building an
Granary improvement. If it strikes a city with no Granary, all food in
the food storage box is lost and the city's population is reduced.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fire:</b> Fire can hit any city at any time. It can be prevented by
building an Aqueduct improvement. Fire destroys one city improvement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Flood:</b> Flood can strike any city built next to or on a River square.
It can be prevented by building a City Walls improvement. Flood reduces
city population.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Piracy:</b> Pirate Raids may strike any city built adjacent to an Ocean
square. Pirates can be prevented by building a Barracks improvement.
Pirates remove all food from the storage box and destroy whatever is
being built in the production box. All resources spent so far in
production are lost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plague:</b> Plague may strike any city at any time. It can be prevented
by acquiring the advance of Medicine or by building an Aqueduct
improvement. Plague reduces the city's population.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Volcano:</b> A volcano may erupt and damage any city built adjacent to
or on Mountain terrain. The effects of a volcano may be neglected by
building a Temple improvement in the city. Volcanic eruptions reduce the
city's population unless negated.</font></td></tr>

<br><font size="1" face="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
 changes have been made to this manual which are different from the 
original. I have not removed any major content, but the title pages are 
not represented here, and neither are the copyright and registration 
notices at the back. Some corrections were made to account for 
grammatical errors and typos in the original manual. I also removed the 
part where it tells you how to load a game from within a game. This 
function seems to have been taken out of the game (Notice the blank line
 in the Game menu), so I didn't want to have anyone confused. Plus, all 
page references were removed, including the ones which simply said "turn
 to page XX" ??? If you notice any more errors in this document, please <a href="mailto:civ1@civfanatics.com">E-mail me</a>
 and I'll fix them. Some may note that large sections of this manual 
seem to be missing from this manual, namely the Players' Notes and 
Designers' Notes sections. My hard copy of the manual is a later 
printing with these sections omitted, so sorry. If someone has the 
complete manual and will give me (in TeXT form) those missing chapters, I
 will add them to this and give credit.</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br>
